<p>Happy Sunday Friends!</p><p>Hello from the National Capital Region! Traveling is back! Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>"We can complain because rose bushes have thorns, or rejoice because thorns have roses."</p><p>-Alphonse Karr</p><div><hr></div><p>"What if the solution to a frustrating situation isn’t to change it, but to change how we approach it? Sometimes, the answer isn’t to complain or fix, but to find the right sauce to make it work."</p><p>Life is full of moments where the reality of a situation doesn’t meet expectation. It’s tempting to focus on the flaws, to point fingers, demand change. But often, the most transformative response isn’t to alter the situation—it’s to alter our perspective. This is a lesson I’ve learned both at home and at work, and it’s one I’m reminded of constantly.</p><p>Imagine this: You’ve had a grueling day. Meetings stretched too long, deadlines loomed, and you finally arrive home, late, drained. Dinner is waiting for you, but it’s cold. The noodles have hardened, and the meat is dry. The first instinct might be frustration—"Why couldn’t this have been left warming? Why couldn't it be less dry? Why isn't it better?"</p><p>But pause. Zoom out. That dinner represents care. Despite their own challenges, someone thought of you, made an effort, and tried to bring you comfort. The truth isn’t that dinner should have been better. The truth is that we need to recognize the effort. Find the Sriracha, that Ranch, or some Sweet Baby Rays. We need to add our own “sauce” and make it good. Gratitude and perspective—those are what's really missing.</p><p>The Stoics often remind us to focus on what we can control. Marcus Aurelius said, "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." Applying this to our example, we see that the situation itself isn’t the problem; it’s our perception of it. By shifting our focus from what the dinner isn’t to what it represents, we unlock an entirely different response: gratitude instead of resentment, action instead of complaint.</p><p>This principle applies far beyond the dinner table. It’s a mindset that can transform relationships, leadership, and even cybersecurity strategies. Let’s explore how this philosophy plays out in a professional context.</p><p>A few years ago, I was leading an initiative that wasn’t going as planned. The tools we had implemented weren’t meeting expectations, the team was frustrated, and morale was slipping. The temptation to lash out at vendors, blame colleagues, or throw the entire project into chaos was strong. But stepping back, I realized that none of these actions would solve the root issue. The problem wasn’t the tools or the team—it was how we were using them.</p><p>Instead of scrapping everything, we took a different approach. We reassessed, identified what was working, doubled down on strengths, and found creative ways to address the gaps. We added “sauce”—whether that meant integrating complementary solutions, reshaping workflows, or simply rallying the team by recognizing we were sucking, owning it as the lead, and reestablishing a shared sense of purpose. The outcome? A turnaround that not only salvaged the project but strengthened our team’s resilience and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Just as gratitude and perspective can elevate a cold dinner into a meaningful meal, reframing challenges in cybersecurity can transform setbacks into opportunities. It’s not about masking problems but enhancing them with thoughtful action.</p><p>Here are some ways to apply this principle in life and leadership:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pause Before Reacting:</strong> When faced with frustration, take a moment to step back and reassess. What’s the real truth of the situation?</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Your Sauce:</strong> Identify what’s within your control to improve the situation. Gratitude, effort, or creativity can often make all the difference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Celebrate Effort:</strong> Recognize and acknowledge the contributions of others, <strong>even if the result isn’t perfect</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reframe Challenges:</strong> In cybersecurity, as in life, ask, “What can we build on?” instead of “What’s wrong?”</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Leadership isn’t about fixing flaws; it’s about seasoning strengths.</p></li><li><p>Resilience begins with perspective—reframe the problem, and you reshape its impact.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Do what you want without permission from someone else.</p><p>Go to the party. Get drunk. Start the business. Scroll on your phone all night. Do whatever your little heart desires. Seriously, because denying those desires is only going to bind you to them.</p><p>But there's a catch.</p><p>You need to be able to realize when those things are a mistake. | Dan Koe</p></li><li><p>“Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay” | J. Krishnamurti </p></li><li><p>“Work expands so as to fill the time allotted for completion” | Parkinson’s Law</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>What situations in your life or work could benefit from a little more “sauce”? Where might you be focusing on flaws instead of opportunities? Reflecting on these questions can open the door to creative solutions and stronger relationships.</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><p></p><p>p.s.
