<p>Happy Sunday Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p><strong>“</strong>The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? <strong>The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.</strong></p><p>-Seneca</p><p>Greetings from Norfolk! I’m just coming out of the sessions with the wonderful 757 folks. </p><p>The Clipt team and I took a journey this week to and through 757’s first builder’s workshop run by a great team. The construct was to come up with an idea and bring it to marketable and business viability during only the time to set up and execute the workshop. </p><p>If I were to describe it in a single term, it would be improvisational execution. Taking something, not overthinking or over planning, just making it happen with the group of people you have never met at the event (all extremely talented, mind you). In other words, the less you think about something, the more likely you are to get it done.</p><p>Now, The intent was to flesh out and code a program, an app, an LLM, etc. But we went with something different. We very much want to create a web app to provide a computer avenue for our business clientele that don’t want to, or can’t, rely on a mobile device for their accounts. So that was one facet for development.</p><p>The more fun, and improvisational side, was to pull together a live demo of the business model in front of everyone at the event.</p><p>In the spirit of improvisational execution, we thought “What if we also pull together a live demo of the business model in front of everyone at the event?” “That’s crazy, let’s do it”.</p><p>I cleared the plan with the hosts while Zach and Amy locked in a stylist for six on location sessions. </p><p>We spent two days with a new Dev, Grey, that we met who’s an epic up and comer figuring out layout and wire framing in Figma. We tried using ReTool, and finally settled on Plasmic for a prototype build. We had an amazing time just rolling with ideas, figuring things out as we went and everyone learned a ton. </p><p>On Saturday we sprung the demo. The stylist showed up right on time,  we popped up the advertising and I jumped in the seat for the first cut (I also really needed a haircut). Eliza, the stylist, was fantastic. She crushed the sessions and everyone had a great time. We cut and trimmed up both hosts as well as three other folks at the event who were quick to take up on the offer.</p><p>We chatted with other entrepreneurs, business owners, and mentors at the event for the rest of the day. There was a little part of me that was worried what people would think. Pretty much everyone loved it. Success. We hadn’t planned it originally, we came up with an idea, didn’t over think it and took advantage of a created opportunity.</p><p>Improvisation. Execution.</p><p>Currently, I’m sitting in the living room of two of my great friends and business partners after wrapping up a weekend of great efforts in learning more about entrepreneurialism and having some great quality time with our families. </p><p>If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.</p><p>-e</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>When you’re in an unknown or uncertain situation, make small decisions. Keep making them until you have created the time and space to capitalize on what works. When it stops working, make small decisions.</p></li><li><p>Get Started. You can adjust an imperfect plan. Waiting for the perfect plan will get you nowhere; because it doesn’t exist.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>“Whatever you’re doing, a sense of superiority will make you worse at it. Humility, on the other hand, will make you better. The moment you think you’ve got it all figured out, your progress stops. Instead, continue to advance and improve by reminding yourself how much more there will always be to discover.”  - Ralph Marston</p></li><li><p>“Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus.” - Alexander Graham Bell</p></li><li><p>MIT researchers created an imaging algorithm that uses device ambient light sensors to capture images (blurry prototype) without access to the camera. Not previously considered a privacy risk, this has some interesting implications for previously innocuous devices like smart home devices and Wi-Fi access points for some 1984-like possibilities in unwitting surveillance. | <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/19/could-this-crazy-new-smartphone-hack-turn-2024-into-1984/?sh=783607c734f4">More</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>Think about the people who if you called right now would pick up. Are those the only people in your inner circle? Why not?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Send Me Some Feedback!</h2><p>What did you like? What else do you want to see or what should I eliminate?
