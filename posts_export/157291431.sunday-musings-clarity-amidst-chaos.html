<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing on this week, 2 ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”</p><p> | Viktor Frankle</p><div><hr></div><p>Have you ever felt like the world around you is unraveling while you’re struggling to keep your sense of self intact? The noise, the outrage, the endless stream of chaos—it’s enough to make anyone lose themselves. But what if the real test isn’t about changing the world, but about not letting it change you? The temptation to react, to meet aggression with equal force, is strong. But real strength—the kind that endures—comes not from resistance, but from clarity. The ability to remain composed, to hold steady in the storm, is what sets apart those who merely survive from those who thrive.</p><p><strong>Find and Hold onto the Truth</strong></p><p>The modern battle isn’t just against oppression but also against the flood of misinformation. Unlike in the past, where malign actors suppressed and controlled the truth, today’s actors are subtler: the inundation of half-truths, distractions, and contradictions, making it nearly impossible to tell what the truth is amidst the flood of headlines and information. The goal isn’t simply control but confusion. Those who cultivate discernment—who sharpen their ability to separate truth from distortion—are the ones who navigate the chaos with clarity and confidence.</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Limit your exposure to reactionary media. Instead of drowning in news cycles designed to provoke emotion, seek long-form, thoughtful perspectives. Curate your information diet with care.</p><p><strong>Be Yourself—Especially When It’s Hard</strong></p><p>The worst thing chaos can do to you isn’t external; it’s internal. It isn’t the riots, the bad actors, or the misinformation—it’s the temptation to let it change you. To absorb the anger, to let fear and frustration warp your character, to become part of the chaos instead of rising above it. But that’s the real loss: not of comfort or stability, but of self. The only antidote? See the disorder, recognize its presence, but refuse to let it define you. Know yourself so deeply that external madness can't shape you. Your thoughts, your actions, your integrity—these are the things within your control. Hold them close and let them guide you to something better.</p><p><strong>Quick hack:</strong> Grab a notebook and write one page about what’s truly yours—your values, your thoughts. Do this daily, and you’ll start to notice the noise losing its grip on you.</p><p><strong>Understand That People Will Always Be Who They Are</strong></p><p>There’s no world in which everyone is fair, kind, or rational. The Stoics understood this well—they saw people as actors playing their predetermined roles. The rude, the dishonest, the manipulative—they have always existed, and they always will. They must be as they are. Since they cannot help but play their part, we need not waste energy trying to change them or make them understand the folly of their ways. Their presence isn’t personal, nor is it a reflection of you. Accept it, move on, and focus on your own path.</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Instead of reacting to negativity, respond with neutrality. A simple pause before engaging can be the difference between losing control and maintaining peace.</p><p><strong>Focus on What You Can Control</strong></p><p>Most things aren’t in our control, and trying to control them only breeds frustration, anxiety, fear, and negativity. But knowing this frees us to focus on doing less, better. The very few things that are within our control—our actions, our responses, our emotions—deserve our full attention. The irony? The more we fixate on the uncontrollable, the more powerless we feel. The alternative is simple, though not always easy: turn inward. What do you have agency over? Your mind. Your choices. Your reactions. No one can force you to feel anxious or angry without your permission. Guard that permission fiercely.</p><p><strong>Quick hack:</strong> When overwhelmed, write down two lists: things you control and things you don’t. Then, act only on the first list.</p><p><strong>Resist the Urge to React</strong></p><p>In turbulent times, emotional extremes become the norm. We feel pressured to react instantly, to have an immediate opinion on everything. Don’t. Slow down. Put your thought and opinion to the test and not get swept away in the tide. Train yourself to respond deliberately rather than react impulsively. To remain steady when the world is volatile is not a weakness—it’s a rare strength.</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Next time someone says something inflammatory, take a breath and count to ten before you respond. Feel the difference in control.</p><p><strong>Learn from the Past</strong></p><p>Do your job as a citizen. Be informed, participate in public affairs, and understand what is happening—not by consuming sensationalized media, but by seeking enduring wisdom. The media fights for control over the six inches between your ears, peddling speculation and fleeting narratives. Instead of chasing every snippet of news, acknowledge what is happening as an event in history and seek deeper understanding.</p><p>There has, without a doubt, been an era in history where someone, smarter or dumber than us, went through something similar and documented their experience. We have the privilege to learn from the past—whether through history books or even fiction—which offers insights free from the immediacy and manipulation of today’s headlines.</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Find a historical figure who faced adversity with resilience and study how they navigated it. Let their mindset shape yours.</p><p><strong>See the Opportunity</strong></p><p>Even in times of chaos, there is opportunity. During my time at the Pentagon during the COVID crisis, I turned to the past—studying the Spanish Flu, Polio, and H1N1 to model and anticipate trends. It wasn’t a perfect answer, but it provided light in the darkness, helping me separate hysteria from reality. Looking to history didn’t just give me perspective—it gave me a framework for making informed decisions in real time. I was able to use those insights to drive key daily decisions, identifying patterns and predicting resurgences while maintaining a sense of clarity instead of panic.</p><p>Uncertainty forces us to think differently. In turbulence, we can either be overwhelmed by the moment or step back and search for timeless patterns to guide our choices. In uncertainty, there is room to innovate, to grow, to develop resilience. These moments test us—but they also shape us. Will you let turbulence make you bitter, reactive, and afraid? Or will you use it to become stronger, kinder, and more disciplined?</p><p><strong>Quick hack:</strong> Reframe uncertainty as a test. Instead of asking, “Why is this happening to me?” ask, “How can this make me better?”</p><p><strong>The Path Forward</strong></p><p>The Stoics had a word for this: <strong>Euthymia</strong>—the sense of knowing one’s path and staying on it, undistracted by external chaos or the intersecting paths of others. It is cultivated through reflection, through stripping away external influences and recognizing what thoughts are truly your own. If you don’t control your own mind, external actors will gladly do it for you, often without you even realizing it.</p><p>Remember, the things that happen they can only harm you if it harms your character—if it makes you bitter, vindictive, or entitled. No one else gets to decide if a challenge degrades or improves you; that power is yours alone. And just because someone seems to be getting away with something doesn’t make it right or wise. We do what’s right because it’s right, not because it’s convenient or rewarded. A life lived otherwise is an exhausting existence.</p><p>And above all: nothing that happens around you has the power to break you unless you allow it to. Chaos will always exist. Your peace, however, is yours to keep.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>If one’s sense of right and wrong shifts based on social approval, it’s not integrity.</p></li><li><p>Your attention is your most valuable resource—far more than money or time. Where you direct it shapes your thoughts, your emotions, and ultimately, your identity. The greatest form of personal sovereignty is the ability to choose where your attention goes, rather than having it dictated by external forces.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong>A book:</strong> <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em> by Viktor Frankl – A timeless reminder of the power of choice in adversity.</p></li><li><p><strong>A practice:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/BQHo-z-pA8E?si=CaRkz4Bo5szEIXgJ">How To Fix Your Negative Patterns with Alain de Botton</a> | Chris Williamson - 👍️</p></li><li><p><strong>A quote:</strong> “The greatest sign of success for a teacher is to be able to say, “The children are now working as if I did not exist.” But this holds true for leadership in general—give people space and they flourish.” – Maria Montessori</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p>Think about an aspect of your life that feels chaotic.
