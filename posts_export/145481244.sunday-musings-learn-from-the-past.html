<p>Happy Sunday Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p>“History never repeats itself. Man always does.”</p><p>-Voltaire</p><div><hr></div><p>You’re not the first person in your work role, you’re not the first father of twins. You’re also not the first guy to get married, nor the first guy in the military or to start a business.</p><p>Odds are, someone has accomplished or failed at what you’re attempting to do here and wrote about it. They might be much smarter than you, or dumber. Either way, they are giving you an advantage they didn’t have.</p><p>History, unraveled, is our willing tutor; there to explain the past and help you accumulate the essential building blocks of future wisdom.</p><p>Applying and implementing new methodologies and/or technologies to those elements of past successes and failures increase the odds that I'm going to create a new and inventive solution (or maybe a new and inventive way to fail).</p><p>There is a story that Zeno visited an Oracle when he was a young man. She told him that he will find wisdom when he has conversations with the dead. </p><p>She wasn’t telling him to buy a Ouija board; she was encouraging him to read. Books are how we can really converse with the dead, ask our questions and research literary works to find what they have to say. Leading armies? Ask Napoleon, Clausewitz, or Jomini. Want to work through a pandemic? Get an accounting from the survivors (and victims) of the plagues in history. None of them are alive anymore, but through the pages of books, even though they’ve left, they’re still here to help us.</p><p>Why reject the open invitation to converse with the greats? When you don’t you are, as Jim Mattis said, functionally illiterate by deliberately choosing not to read. </p><p>To find wisdom, you must start with history. </p><p>History is the repository of all human knowledge and experience. From there we can derive theory. From validated theory, we create tradecraft, practice, and doctrine. From those, we create history. </p><p>There is enough history to fill your lifetime. Use it to make your lifetime something the next generations can learn from also.</p><p>-e (the You I’m talking to)</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>If you have time to doom-scroll, you have time to read books. We should, absolutely, avail ourselves of the latest technologies and research. But never at the cost of understanding timeless truths will teach us more about humans today than contemporary pundits.</p></li><li><p>Things that have never happened before happen frequently. And yet, there is nothing new under the sun. There is a rhythm to humanity; the goal is to learn to sway with it and fill in the notes.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://dev.to/aarushikansal/giving-your-large-language-model-skills-stoicism-meets-ai-5gd1">Giving your Large Language Model skills: Stoicism Meets AI</a> - Aarushi Kansal | <a href="https://dev.to/aarushikansal/giving-your-large-language-model-skills-stoicism-meets-ai-5gd1">More</a> <br>    Upload the works of your preferred philosopher, ruler, strategist to your preferred AI model. Then have a conversation to help with your research</p></li><li><p>“But nobody ever lived in the past, only in the present. The difference is that it was their present. They were just as alive and full of ambition, fear, hope, all the emotions of life. And just like us, they didn’t know how it would all turn out. The challenge is to get the reader beyond thinking that things had to be the way they turned out and to see the range of possibilities of how things could have been otherwise.” | David McCullough</p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/GZ3zL7kT6_c?si=OZITF487hCCnVxf2">Lose Control</a> | Teddy Swims<br>   Many of you already know I’m a bit of an audiophile.
