<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! As we near February, many folks are handling a rather tumultuous and stressful time. Some of us are taking taking new paths in life (expected or otherwise). Some of us are staying our present course and navigating new requirements and scrutiny. Others of us are largely unaffected, unencumbered. Reflection and intention are powerful ways to stay true to ourselves, our nature, and stay aligned the person we know we should and want to be.</p><p>As always, here is 1 quote I’m musing on this, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“Do what nature demands. Get on with it, if you have the opportunity, and don’t look around to see if people will know about it. Don’t hope for Plato’s Republic, but be content with even the smallest step forward, and regard the outcome as a small thing.” | Marcus Aurelius - <em>Meditations</em>, Book 9, Section 29</p><div><hr></div><p>Imagine ancient Thebes, a city of towering walls, standing as a symbol of power and politics in ancient Greece. Within its bustling streets and military strongholds lived Epaminondas—a leader whose name would one day be synonymous with brilliance on the battlefield and unshakable integrity.</p><p>Before his rise to greatness, Epaminondas faced a challenge that had nothing to do with military strategy. It was a moment of attempted subtle humiliation, orchestrated by rivals and meant to end his career before it began. Instead, he set the foundation for his future success—and provides us lesson in leadership that resonates as powerfully today as it did in ancient Thebes.</p><p>For us, this story isn’t just a piece of history. It’s a blueprint for navigating the roles and tasks that feel beneath our ambitions. Because, as we will discover today, the prestige and value of a position aren’t determined by its title—they’re determined by the person who occupies it.</p><p>Epaminondas’ political enemies in Thebes wanted him gone. They couldn’t challenge his intelligence, integrity, or growing influence outright, so they tried to sideline him instead. Their solution? Assign him to oversee the city’s sewer systems.</p><p>In ancient Greece, managing sewers wasn’t just unglamorous—it was humiliating. The task was meant to bury Epaminondas’ career in obscurity, branding him as someone unworthy of significant responsibilities.</p><p>Epaminondas accepted the assignment without protest and approached it with the same diligence and strategic insight that would later define his military campaigns. He studied the city’s sanitation systems, engaged with workers to understand their challenges, and introduced practical improvements that elevated Thebes’ infrastructure.</p><p>Under his leadership, the city’s sewer systems became a model of efficiency, improving public health and the quality of life for its citizens. His work didn’t just transform the role—he elevated its status. What had been a position of humiliation became a proving ground for leadership, coveted by those who wanted to emulate his success.</p><p>Epaminondas demonstrated a timeless truth: leadership isn’t about the prestige of your position. It’s about what you bring to it.</p><p>His story reminds us that life often disguises its most important lessons as slammed doors, insults, or inconveniences. These may feel beneath us, but they’re not barriers to our ambitions—they’re challenges designed to strengthen and improve our character and prepare us for something greater.</p><p>For cyber and information security, the parallels are clear. Many critical roles in our field don’t come with glory or recognition. Routine tasks like governance and risk management, managing compliance audits, conducting vulnerability assessments, or overseeing access control systems might seem unremarkable. They lack the drama of a headline-making breach or the prestige of presenting in a boardroom.</p><p>But these “sewer systems” roles are the backbone of organizational resilience. When leaders treat these types of roles, in any profession, as mere stepping stones—or worse, as beneath them—they miss the opportunity to demonstrate true value. The tasks that feel small are often the ones that define us.</p><p>Consider some of the overlooked roles and tasks in cybersecurity that often feel out of the spotlight:</p><p>1. Compliance Audits</p><p>Compliance frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, or NIST standards are often viewed as bureaucratic hurdles. They involve paperwork, process reviews, and box-checking—work that rarely attracts applause. Yet these audits are essential for building trust with stakeholders and ensuring long-term resilience. Leaders who approach compliance with care and strategy transform it from a regulatory burden into a competitive advantage.</p><p>Imagine preparing for an audit that feels like a routine checkbox exercise. Instead of rushing through it, ask: How can I simplify this process for the team next year? What trends in the findings could I suss out as potential risks?</p><p>2. Vulnerability Management</p><p>Running routine vulnerability scans or patching systems can feel monotonous. But this work is the foundation of security. A leader who takes the time to streamline these processes, address root causes, and educate teams doesn’t just prevent incidents—they set a standard for operational excellence.</p><p>3. Incident Documentation</p><p>Post-incident reviews and documentation are often rushed or overlooked in favor of “getting back to work.” But investing in these processes—analyzing root causes, improving communication, and sharing lessons learned—turns every incident into an opportunity for growth, to make the entire system better.</p><p>These are our modern equivalents of managing the sewers of Thebes. They may not feel glamorous, but they’re tests that prepare us for greater leadership.</p><p>Why do we resist these challenges? Often, the answer is simple: ego.</p><p>As Ryan Holiday reminds us in Ego is the Enemy, our pride blinds us to opportunities. When we view certain roles or tasks as beneath us, we’re not just rejecting the work—we’re rejecting the growth that comes with it.</p><p>Epaminondas could have refused the sewer assignment, citing his intelligence or military ambitions. Instead, he embraced it as an opportunity to prove his value. He understood that leadership isn’t about titles—it’s about the dignity you bring to the work.</p><p>In cybersecurity, where much of our success is invisible to others(no negative proofs, right?), this lesson is especially relevant. True leaders don’t seek validation through titles or recognition. They focus on substance, knowing that the work itself is what matters.</p><p>For those of us navigating roles that feel beneath their ambitions, here are five strategies to embrace the challenges:</p><p>1. Reframe the Task</p><p>What can I learn from this? How can I add value? Treat every assignment as an opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities, no matter how small it seems.</p><p>2. Focus on Mastery</p><p>Excellence in the small things builds momentum. Whether it’s managing a patch schedule or conducting a compliance audit, aim to leave the task better than you found it. Remember, how we do anything is how we do everything.</p><p>3. Find the Connection to the Bigger Picture</p><p>Even routine tasks contribute to organizational success. Take the time to understand how your work supports larger goals and communicate that vision to your team.</p><p>4. Elevate Others</p><p>Leadership isn’t just about what you do—it’s about inspiring those around you. Use overlooked roles to mentor your team, build trust, and foster collaboration. Catch your people doing good.</p><p>5. Recognize the Test for What It Is</p><p>When faced with a task that feels beneath you, pause and reflect: What lesson is this moment offering me? Challenges are often the stepping stones to greater opportunities.</p><p>By the end of his career, Epaminondas had broken Sparta’s dominance, liberated Thebes, and redefined what it meant to be a leader. But his transformation of the city’s sewer systems remains one of his most enduring lessons. It’s a reminder that the work we do in the shadows often shapes our brightest moments.</p><p>For cybersecurity professionals, the takeaway is clear: the tasks and roles that feel unremarkable are not obstacles—they’re opportunities. How we approach them determines our trajectory.</p><p>Being a leader isn’t about titles or recognition. It’s about how you show up in every moment, no matter how small. And when you bring excellence and integrity to even the most unremarkable work, you don’t simply overcome the challenge—you define what it means to lead.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Adversity condenses time-it teaches us in days what comfort couldn’t in years.</p></li><li><p>The power to shape the tools of the mind is the power to shape the future.

Is there a routine task, a low-visibility role, or a challenge you’ve been avoiding because it feels unworthy of your time? What would happen if you embraced it fully—not as an insult, but as an opportunity?</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
