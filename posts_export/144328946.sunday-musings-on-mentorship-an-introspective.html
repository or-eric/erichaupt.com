<p>Happy Sunday Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p>“Without a ruler to do it against, you can’t make crooked straight.”</p><p>-Seneca</p><div><hr></div><p>As a serial beginner, from design to videography to video editing to photography and back to design, then intelligence, and now cyber, I’ve have realized there’s almost nothing better than to apprentice under someone who’s great at the skill or profession you’re undertaking. </p><p>In the past month, I’ve had the very amazing opportunity to observe many very senior leaders in the process of creating strategies and making decisions for populations that vary from hundreds to hundreds of thousands. I learned that I have learned a lot and that I have so very much more to learn; I’m absolutely not ready to take on one of their roles, and I won’t be ready without a long apprenticeship.</p><p>Make no mistake, my hours are long, I don’t make any more money than before, and there’s no prestige. But the opportunity to absorb, the unique insights from observing several levels up and understand how those microcosms work is immense. Using them as the straight edge to check for where I’m crooked and then better understand where (and what) I need to improve or correct is a much truer way to improve than solely through hard-won experience.</p><p>To learn from someone who’s farther along than you, who’s been through similar (or the same) struggles you are going through or will go through is the fastest way towards improvement and, eventually, mastery.</p><p>For examples, I’ll talk about what I look for in those I want to apprentice under.</p><p>Select the mentor that embodies and can teach you at least one of the qualities you aspire to and has the experience to guide you through challenges. I look for mentors that possess a blend of technical prowess, strategic insight, and a solid ethical foundation. </p><p>In cybersecurity, this could mean someone with experience in incident response, various security frameworks, or (in my case) leadership roles that require a deep understanding of complex policies and international law across myriad ecosystems. This sounds a lot like having theoretical knowledge as well as practical wisdom gained through real-world challenges.</p><p>Epictetus reminds us on the importance of living in accordance with one's principles. A person who embodies integrity and ethical behavior sets a strong example for those they guide. The right mentor for me shows consistency in their actions and words, reinforcing the moral compass that guides their journey. </p><p>Effective communication is a critical element when choosing a mentor. Approachable (in their way), listens actively, and provides clear, constructive feedback. This is particularly important in our lines of work, where complex jargon and technical details can be overwhelming and will mean different things at different junctures.</p><p>I like to find a mentor who can break down complicated concepts into understandable terms and communicate with empathy. </p><p>In my more policy-programmatic-law-driven cybersecurity pursuit, I seek mentors to help me be someone I want to be. Someone who possesses not only technical expertise but also strategic thinking and an understanding of the broader implications of security in a connected world. Additionally, perhaps most importantly, possess a set of values that remain an unshakeable foundation to an otherwise formless and flexible personality.</p><p>The best find people like <a href="https://armyhistory.org/major-general-fox-conner/">Fox Conner</a>, who mentored Eisenhower, Patton, and Marshall. Apprenticeship under the right mentor is going to take longer than you want, it’s going to be painful as you (I) straighten yourself against them (Fox Connor forced Eisenhower to read On War three times), but it’s how we learn. Moreover, it’s the fast track to becoming great. </p><p>-e</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>The best mentors don't simply give answers; they ask questions to lead you down your own road of discovery.</p></li><li><p>This bit of introspection and research tells me that mentorship isn’t about molding another into one’s own image; it’s about helping them to build the best version of theirs.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>“Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people." – Steve Jobs (man Steve has a bunch of really great ones)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/4a2hzql">48 Laws of Power</a> - Robert Greene | Robert is one of a few people I’d call a modern philosopher and strategist without reservation. I also love that this book, specifically, has been banned in several countries and U.S. prisons for the types of information it contains.</p></li><li><p>“Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look weak. It is a principal impediment to power.” - Robert Greene</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>Analyze yourself and identify where you are weak in respect to the person you see yourself being. Who is strong in the areas you find yourself lacking and how can you learn from them?</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
