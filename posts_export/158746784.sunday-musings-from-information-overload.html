<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing on this week, 2 ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.”</p><p> | Niels Bohr</p><div><hr></div><h3>Learning How to Learn (Fast!)</h3><p>Most of us don’t actually know how to learn.</p><p>Studies show that within 24 hours, we forget nearly 70% of new information unless we actively engage with it. Despite consuming endless tutorials and books, many of us find ourselves stuck—unable to apply what we've "learned."</p><p>Why do we keep doing this?</p><p>For many of us, learning has become a form of mental procrastination—giving the illusion of progress without real-world results. It’s passive, unstructured, and ineffective. Worse, it tricks us into thinking we’re moving forward when we’re really just spinning our wheels.</p><p>Here’s the truth: We're learning too slowly.</p><p>But what if we could learn way faster? What if you could master a new skill in weeks, not years? You could finally launch that app, complete that portfolio project, or articulate complex ideas with confidence.</p><p>The good news? You can do it. If you change how you approach learning.</p><p>This article is not theoretical. It’s practical. Keep a notebook handy, because by the end, you’ll have a clear, actionable roadmap to learning anything—fast.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Meta-Skill: Learning How to Learn</h2><p>The ability to learn is the ultimate competitive advantage—because it liberates us from the confines of an aging education system built on outdated methodologies. Traditional education often fails us, focusing on rote memorization instead of real-world application. Schools emphasize standardized testing but provide little guidance on <em>how</em> to effectively acquire and apply knowledge. In contrast, those who master the skill of learning itself gain the flexibility to adapt, innovate, and thrive in any environment—free from the limitations of aging curriculums and obsolete teaching methods.</p><p>I can't count how many hours I've spent chasing "hacks" to learn or study faster. But before we dive into anything, we need to ask ourselves: <em>Why are we learning this?</em></p><h3>1) Define Your Learning Map</h3><p>Before you learn <em>anything</em>, ask yourself: <em>Why am I learning this?</em></p><p>People pick random topics to study without considering whether they align with their goals, strengths, or aspirations. This is why so many of us abandon learning—we lack a compelling reason to continue.</p><h4>Your first step: Create a Learning Map</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Write out what you don’t want in life.</strong> (e.g., "I don’t want to be stuck in a dead-end job.")</p></li><li><p><strong>Write out what you want in life.</strong> (e.g., "I want to be financially independent by 35.")</p></li><li><p><strong>List 5-10+ bullet points under each.</strong> These will become your <em>learning filters</em>.</p></li></ol><p> 📝 <em>Pause here.</em> Open a notes app and jot down three ideas you’d love to explore as projects.</p><p>Anything you learn should directly contribute to achieving what you <em>do</em> want or avoiding what you <em>don’t</em> want. This keeps your learning focused and prevents distractions.</p><h3>2) Just-in-Time Learning (Project-Based Learning)</h3><p>Most of us think learning starts with theory. It doesn’t.</p><p>It starts with action.</p><p>Instead of passively consuming information, you should immediately apply what you learn to a <em>real-world project</em>. Traditional education teaches us to stockpile knowledge 'just in case' we need it someday. But real learning happens 'just in time'—grabbing the information only when it becomes relevant to what we’re working on. This taps into the 'desirable difficulty' principle in cognitive science—the idea that learning through challenge leads to deeper retention and mastery. By struggling through real problems, our brains form stronger neural connections, making the knowledge stick.

By struggling through real problems, our brains form stronger neural connections, making the knowledge stick.</p><h4>The Project-Based Learning Formula:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Choose a project</strong> that moves you closer to your goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brainstorm everything you need to know</strong> to complete it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Study only when needed.</strong> Seek out information <em>as problems arise</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Capture insights</strong> in a dedicated notes system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Share your progress publicly.</strong> (More on this later.)</p></li></ol><h3>3) Start with What You Know</h3><p>Learning happens through struggle—not memorization.</p><p>Rather than cramming information, <em>start with what you already know</em>, attempt the task, and only seek guidance when you hit a roadblock.</p><h4>The Just-in-Time Learning Loop:</h4><ol><li><p>Try to do it (even if you don’t know how).</p></li><li><p>Identify the knowledge gap.</p></li><li><p>Search for answers (AI, Google, books, experts).</p></li><li><p>Apply the solution.</p></li><li><p>Repeat until mastery.</p></li></ol><h3>4) Leverage AI as Your Co-Pilot</h3><p>🤖 A decade ago, Google Fu was a skill. Today, Prompting AI is the same skill. But AI isn’t just a search tool—it’s a sparring partner, a co-pilot in achieving our goals. It can help guide us, clarify concepts, and streamline our learning process, but the outcome will only be as good as we are and how much effort we put in. The real power lies in how we use it.</p><p>Let’s say you’re working on a creative project. Instead of sifting through hours of videos, ask AI, <em>“How do I blend two photos together?”</em> Instant clarity.</p><h3>5) Write to Reflect and Grow</h3><p>Learning isn’t just about input—it’s about output.</p><p>Writing down your thoughts, lessons, and insights makes learning tangible and forces you to articulate your understanding.</p><p>Start small:</p><ul><li><p>Write a short Twitter thread on what you learned today.</p></li><li><p>Publish a blog post explaining a key concept.</p></li><li><p>Share your project progress weekly.</p></li></ul><p>Over time, this builds an <em>intellectual portfolio</em> that attracts people, opportunities, and income.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Final Piece: Make It a Habit</h3><p>⏳ Nobody will <em>give</em> us time to learn.</p><p>We have to <em>take</em> it.</p><p>Put your learning blocks in your calendar. Make them as non-negotiable as work meetings. Eliminate distractions. Build momentum.</p><p>The reward? Mastery.</p><p>Most of us <em>wish</em> for change. But you—you’re different.</p><p>You're about to <em>make</em> it happen.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Struggle is a Feature, Not a Bug.</strong> Cognitive science proves that desirable difficulty—struggling before finding the right answer—cements learning. Frustration signals that your brain is forming stronger neural pathways. The struggle isn’t failure; it’s progress in disguise.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI Won’t Replace You—But Someone Using AI Might.</strong> Treat AI as a co-pilot, not a crutch. The better you are at prompting and synthesizing AI-generated insights, the further ahead you'll be. It’s not AI replacing humans—it’s humans who know how to use AI replacing those who don’t.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things This Week</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Tool</strong> <strong>-</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.napkin.ai/">Napkin</a></strong> (https://www.napkin.ai/) | An AI-powered idea organizer that helps you collect and connect thoughts visually, making it great for synthesizing new learning concepts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Podcast -</strong> <strong>Avoiding Distractions &amp; Doing Deep Work</strong> | Dr. Cal Newport &amp; Dr. Andrew Huberman on deep work and focus strategies. | <a href="https://youtu.be/f7V76Ky-_v8?si=dhwHp7ld_5iyW_8n">More</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Book -</strong> <strong>The Great Mental Models Volume 3: Systems and Mathematics</strong> by Rhiannon Beaubien. | Systems and mathematical thinking to enhance understanding and decision-making.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p>What’s one project you can start today that forces you into action?
