We have financial officers, legal officers, administrative officers, operations, you get the picture. If we start spouting off legal or financial advice (as examples), regardless of our intentions, at best, we create friction with our partners around the table. At worst, we introduce undue risk and posture the board for poor decisions.</p><p>So, we’ve just landed a great leadership role, doesn’t matter if it is technical or not. How do we begin? It’s important that we set the right tone, direction, and expectations. Remember, security is there to help the organization achieve its goals (make money, reduce costs and risks). You might need to apply the brakes, but those should be braking to go faster (like an F1 car), not brakes to stop momentum.</p><p>I like to start my first 90 days with the same strategy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Conduct organizational analysis</strong>.</p><p>What are the strategic objectives, future forecast/goals, what are the issues, what is the risk climate?</p></li><li><p><strong>Understand the future state.</strong></p><p>Through honest and direct talks with stakeholders, ask questions to understand the system, application, network, infrastructure, and organizational architecture. Based on the forecast, where is the organization headed that we’ll need to work with legal and compliance?</p></li><li><p><strong>Assess the current state</strong> (Ask what’s working, what’s not working, how can I help).</p><p>This includes systems, processes, policies, personnel, and relationships within the organization. Where are the fires (failures?), who are the power brokers (official and unofficial), who are the shadow brokers? Where is the shadow IT (there is always shadow IT)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gap Analysis.</strong></p><p>This is the future state minus the current state (with resources and capabilities available) ((Future - Current)). Through your analysis and discussions with peers, subordinates, and stakeholders in the company and consult outside the organization to identify a wide range of possible solutions. <strong>This is a critical step!</strong></p><p>Come up with a list of possible solutions and alternatives for leadership. <strong>Talk in terms of risk, controls, and costs (consult the CFO).</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Program Objectives and Milestones</strong></p><p><strong>(Here’s where we are, where we want to be, and how we’re going to get there).</strong></p><p>Present the leadership with what you’ve observed. Provide multiple approaches to the change management required for your next 12-18 months. Think like the CEO. Speak in business terms and highlight the ways that align with organizational objectives (what are the aspects that support revenue growth). In terms of Cyber Security, we can ensure our internet facing nodes (apps, websites) are compliant and meet regulatory requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inculcate</strong> the understanding that the Cyber (Info) Security element of the organization is there to help the organization meet its goals. Yes, we’re going to look at the organization. Yes, we’re going to ask questions over the first 90 days. Once that happens, we’re going to focus on making appropriate changes where appropriate to knock down the obstacles that prevent us from being as successful as our people can make us.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Example: Availability from the CIA Triad equates to mainstream business.

Now imagine you find out that one of your own employees is trying to steal the ransom money for themselves.</p><p>That’s exactly what happened to Oxford BioMedica back in 2018. </p><p>A member of the organization’s internal staff assigned to investigate the attack broke into the board member’s email account and modified the email to direct the potential payout to their own Bitcoin wallet and sent false emails pressuring them to pay the ransom.</p><p>This is one of those cases that makes you stop and think as a leader. How do you mitigate the risk of a security specialist going rogue? They’re there to have escalated privileges in order to conduct forensics. Logs, audits, and access controls; even on the ones meant to protect are my thoughts.</p><p>Ashley Liles just pled guilty after years of denials.

Chasing the rabbit down the hole; Worldcoins stated mission is three-fold.</p><ol><li><p>Create a global ID</p></li><li><p>Create a global currency</p></li><li><p>Create an app that lets you use the currency in an agile way</p></li></ol><p>Altman and team are doing this all out in the open; publicly working to be the first AGI and at the front of the projected massive disruption of human work. The interesting thing here is that the Worldcoin app uses “<a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/03/21/sam-altman-orb-scan-eyeballs-ai-bot-worldcoin/">the orb</a>” to scan the randomness of the user’s iris and generating a unique encoding based the scan (not storing the biometrics).</p><p>I’m an advocate of advanced biometrics as part of multi-factor authentication and this is a nice push. Being able to uniquely identify humans from A.I. (Global ID) and make sure it’s the correct human is going to become more important as we move forward.</p><p>The global crypto currency element has an interesting theme coming from Worldcoin CEO, Alex Blania. <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/03/21/sam-altman-orb-scan-eyeballs-ai-bot-worldcoin/">They intend to see Worldcoin as the mechanism for distribution of capital creation and the framework for Universal Basic Income</a>. With the last several years of crypto instability, they have their work cut out for them; I’m always interested in big goals with targeted vision.</p><p>With OpenAI dominating the internet and the partnership with Microsoft to drive Bing’s searches, I’m willing to bet Worldcoin will see more people willing to stare into the orb and keep their eyes on the future.</p><p>| <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-got-more-coin-in-latest-115m-raise/">More</a></p><h3><a href="https://twitter.com/neuralink/status/1661857379460468736?s=20">Neuralink Approved for in-human clinical trial.</a></h3><p>In a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/neuralink-says-it-has-the-fdas-ok-to-start-clinical-trials/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1">recent tweet</a>, Neuralink claimed FDA approval for clinical trials. Is this the real answer to how Full Self Driving in Teslas will work? Will we get our twitter feeds direct to the brain housing group? Ancient Alien Theorists say maybe.</p><p>On the more serious side. This is a quick turn from the early 2022 rejection. I imagine this is more an approval for safety testing the combination of surgical robots to implant devices than testing the actual devices yet; but that’s just my assessment. Regardless, I’m interested to see what developments come next.</p><p>| <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/neuralink-says-it-has-the-fdas-ok-to-start-clinical-trials/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1">More</a></p><div><hr></div><h1>Quote I’m Musing</h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png" width="571" height="571" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:571,&quot;bytes&quot;:1264954,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ym90!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b2aeb47-1ccc-4d32-8e23-0c3e5e000fd8_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>“It’s not because things are difficult that we dare not venture.
