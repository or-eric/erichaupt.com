<p>Happy Sunday Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p>“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”</p><p>-Heraclitus</p><div><hr></div><p>Think about the first time you encountered something that changed the way you thought.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time you read a major philosopher like Aristotle, Rusticus, Nietzsche, Seneca, or Kant.</p><p>The first time you heard Nessun Dorma or O mio babbino caro.</p><p>Or maybe it was the discovery of a new technology.</p><p>It opened your eyes to something new, broadened your views and perspective, it opened something up inside you. It was new, you learned something, it was powerful.</p><p>Things were never the same after that.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there is something even more powerful than the new and revelatory.</p><p>Returning to that very thing, that discovery, again and again. When you return, you experience it in a new way, with some gained knowledge and experiences. You can look deeper, discover a nuance that you could never have noticed at the point of initiation.</p><p>We can never set foot in the same river twice, hear the same song twice, read the same words twice. Because we've changed.</p><p>It's this return for a second, a third, a fourth look. Bringing inspection and introspection; comparison and contrast along with application to and of ourselves. That's when we get it. That's where the real insights, breakthroughs, and discoveries lie. That's when we can internalize the processes and become a part of it as well as make it a part of us.</p><p>Revisiting Heraclitus’ quote this week and having a very different thought than <a href="https://erichaupt.substack.com/p/sunday-musings-dont-lose-touch-people?utm_source=publication-search">the last time</a>. I feel it’s apropos.</p><p>-e</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>What we should understand about reading or studying is that the first time only gains us awareness. The second time we get familiar with the nuance. And the third time, and beyond, we begin to gain useful in-depth understanding.</p></li><li><p>Accepting change is embracing the necessary learning requisite to influencing life. And when that thing you want to happen does happen, you won’t be the same person who wished for it.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>“It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.” - Chuck Palahniuk</p></li><li><p>“…Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well. You might be filtering out the advice you need most.” - Conor Barnes</p></li><li><p>Vincible Ignorance - Ignorance that is in the individual’s control to remove by a diligence reasonable to the circumstances. | I would also tie this in the same family as plausible deniability. Intentionally being ignorant of something so that the individual can feel that they are not responsible. <strong>Both of which are logical fallacies. </strong>(Not so much a favorite but as a good thing to know and apply the opposite)</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>There are things you know now that you were ignorant of five years ago. What will be your shortcomings today that you’ll know in five years?</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
