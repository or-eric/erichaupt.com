<p>Happy Sunday Friend!</p><p>Welcome back to another musing! I’m glad you’re here. Here are your Sunday Musings, a quick dose of what I’m exploring and thinking about. If you find it useful, please feel free to forward this along to friends!</p><div><hr></div><h1>In the News</h1><h3>Spain’s Push to Ban End-to-End Encryption Raises Concerns and Debate.</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23819681-law-enforcement-working-party-document-encryption">leaked document</a> obtained by WIRED highlights EU member state discussion on scanning private messages for illegal content. This is an interesting and necessary discussion with decent points on both sides of the discussion. </p><p>The document provides insights into the views of EU countries regarding encryption regulations, and which (15 of the 20) are supportive of the endeavor while navigating the balance between privacy rights and law enforcement.</p><p>It also highlights the depth of understanding those policymakers do or do not have on the subject and a desire to both have privacy and indiscriminate encrypted communication scanning. Notably, the Spanish representatives’ quote:</p><blockquote><p>“Ideally, in our view, it would be desirable to legislatively prevent EU-based service providers from implementing end-to-end encryption,”</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t a new debate (Apple, Eternal Blue) but it is a recent one with new traction. It is true, E2EE may provide a haven for criminals to communicate out of reach of law enforcement. It is also true that once a backdoor for decryption is available to governments (and parents), it becomes a vector to undermine the encryption by criminal organizations; or agents working for those same governments.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, it sets a precedent for the rest of the world.</p><p>| <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/">More</a> | <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23819681-law-enforcement-working-party-document-encryption">PDF here</a></p><h3><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zip-domains-spark-debate-among-cybersecurity-experts/">New ZIP domains spark debate among cybersecurity experts</a></h3><p>Bleeping computer has a great write up on some discussions I’ve had recently regarding Google’s new top-level domains and the security risk they create for phishing and malware, specifically the .zip and .mov. </p><p>The issue here is that these are also extensions and that means we are going to see applications begin to correlate filenames with these extensions to URLs. Do I think this is something to put out an all-points bulletin? I do not. The confusion between filenames and domain names isn’t new. Safe user and business practices such as never clicking on links or download files from unverified sources, and research before you click will largely suffice. Google has active mechanisms in place to suspend or remove malicious domains and monitor emergent threats.</p><p>But it only takes one member of the team to be fooled by legitimate looking phishing attempt like the one below.</p><div class="pullquote"><pre><code><code>https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/archive/refs/tags/@v1.27.1.zip</code></code></pre></div><p>This looks like a legitimate file download from GitHub, but actually takes you to the v1.27.1.zip website.</p><p>Recommended action?

Taamneh, the Supreme Court ruled Twitter will not face accusations that it aided and abetted terrorism by hosting tweets created by ISIS. The court also dismissed Gonzalez v.

I had some time to reflect towards the end of the week and I’ve strayed from this, I think. </p><p>I have high standards for myself and what I do. I don’t make excuses for my shortcomings, and I don’t ask for special treatment. But it’s SELF discipline. It’s meant for me. No one signed up for my standards. Heck, people most likely don’t agree with my standards, and it’s not my charge to hold anyone but myself to them.</p><p>I recall Cato quoted for saying “<em>I can forgive anyone’s errors but my own.</em>”</p><p>As leaders, as humans, we should be tolerant, forgiving, understanding, and empathetic to those we engage with. Take in the context of the situation and circumstances surrounding the events so that we can make the best decisions possible, help as best possible.</p><p>People can suck, the only thing that’s not worthless is to do what’s right, be good, and be patient with those who aren’t. Fairness in the face of unfairness. </p><p>Focus on what we say, what we do, what we think. The rest is not up to us.</p><p>My challenge to myself this month is to refocus on this and to not <strong>“be heard any longer griping about public life”, not even with my own ears </strong>(also pulled from Marcus Aurelius).</p><div><hr></div><h2>I would love your feedback!</h2><p>Which musing is your favorite?
