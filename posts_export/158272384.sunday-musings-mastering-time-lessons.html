<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing on this week, 2 ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“The first step in controlling your world is to control your time.”</p><p> | Napoleon Bonaparte</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Mindset for Time Management</h3><p>You sit down with a clear plan for the day—then emails flood in, Slack pings won’t stop, and before you know it, half the day is gone. Sound familiar? You check off one task, and somehow five more appear. In cybersecurity, leadership, and life, it’s not about getting everything done—it’s about knowing what actually matters.</p><p>Periods of chaos force reflection. Looking back at my career—from combat zones to cybersecurity crises—I’ve realized the key isn’t trying to control everything. It’s knowing what actually matters. Naturally, I thought about my stints in Afghanistan and Iraq. In combat, there’s always another mission, another enemy maneuver, another crisis unfolding in real time. You don’t finish the fight—you manage it. The same holds true for the constant flow of cybersecurity threats, leadership challenges, and daily demands. The work never stops. But that doesn’t mean you have to drown in it.</p><p>Too many chase the illusion of a perfectly cleared to-do list. That day never comes. The battlefield mindset—honed in combat operations management and essential in cybersecurity—is about triage: focusing on the essential, letting go of the inessential, and recognizing that some problems resolve themselves without your intervention.</p><p>Here’s how I this mindset to daily operations.</p><div><hr></div><h2>1. Reset the Day: A Fresh Start, Every Day</h2><p>Every mission begins with a briefing, and every day should begin the same way.</p><ul><li><p>I write everything I need to do on a single <strong>8.5x14 sheet of paper</strong>—nothing digital. The act of writing is deliberate: if it’s not worth writing, it’s not worth doing.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the day, I review my list:</p><ul><li><p>If a task is critical, I finish it.</p></li><li><p>If it <em>might</em> be important tomorrow, I mark it with <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p></li><li><p>If it no longer matters, I let it go.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The next morning, I start fresh with a new sheet. If <code>&gt;&gt;</code> tasks from the previous day still matter, I prioritize them—but most of them don’t. This process forces clarity and prevents clutter.</p></li></ul><p><em>**<strong>Quick Hack:</strong> Use the <strong>3-Minute Rule.</strong> If a task will take less than 3 minutes, do it immediately instead of writing it down. If it takes longer, it belongs on your list.</em>**</p><p>Try this tomorrow: Write your to-do list by hand. Not in an app, not on a random sticky note—on a single sheet of paper. See how it changes your focus. This approach isn’t about productivity for productivity’s sake—it’s about intentionality. It helps you start each day with a clean slate, rather than feeling like you’re carrying over yesterday’s chaos.</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. The Pre-Brief: Setting Priorities Before the Day Becomes Reactive</h2><p>Before jumping into execution mode, I ground myself with a simple exercise:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How am I feeling?</strong> (Am I tired? Focused? Anxious? And why?)</p></li><li><p><strong>What are my top priorities for the month/quarter/year and how am I progressing with them?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What are the three results I must achieve this week?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What is the most important thing to get done today?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What do I need to finish before my day gets hijacked?</strong></p></li></ul><p>It’s easy to let your day get taken over by emails, notifications, and other people’s priorities. This quick check-in keeps you in control, ensuring you’re making progress on what truly matters rather than just reacting to whatever comes your way.</p><p><em>**Quick Hack: Set a <strong>Daily Focus Word.</strong> Each morning, pick one word that defines your priority (e.g., "strategy" or "execution"). Write it at the top of your notes—it keeps your day aligned with what truly matters.**</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>3. Tactical Task Management</h2><p>I’ve adapted elements of bullet journaling into my task management system:</p><ul><li><p><code>=</code> for how I feel (emotional/mental state)</p></li><li><p><code>.</code> for an action item</p></li><li><p><code>o</code> for an event</p></li><li><p><code>–</code> for a note</p></li><li><p><code>@</code> to assign a task to a team member</p></li><li><p><code>!</code> to indicate something I must personally handle</p></li><li><p>A <code>/</code> through a <code>.</code> means the task is in progress, with an arrow (<code>=&gt;</code>) showing its current status</p></li><li><p>An <code>X</code> means completion, and a strikethrough means it’s no longer relevant</p></li></ul><p><em>**Quick Hack: <strong>Timebox the First 90 Minutes.</strong> Before checking emails or Slack, dedicate 90 minutes to your most critical work. This eliminates the distraction spiral</em>.**</p><p>This system helps me stay flexible while keeping track of ongoing tasks without creating unnecessary duplication. It turns my to-do list from an overwhelming pile of tasks into a streamlined system I can trust.</p><div><hr></div><h2>4. Live Triage: Managing the Unexpected</h2><p>Some days go exactly as planned. Most don’t.</p><p>Managing operations in high-stakes environments means priorities shift in seconds. You might be wrapping up a critical analysis when a new crisis demands immediate attention—forcing you to pause, assess, and act decisively.</p><p>The same thing happens in cybersecurity, leadership, or corporate environments:</p><ul><li><p>You’re finishing a report when a <strong>critical vulnerability</strong> is discovered.</p></li><li><p>You’re leading a strategic meeting when an <strong>incident response alert</strong> comes in.</p></li><li><p>You’re deep in analysis or coding when your <strong>boss suddenly needs a deep dive session for testimony.</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>**</strong><em>Quick Hack: Use the <strong>5-5-5 Rule.</strong> If an interruption comes in, ask: Does this need action in 5 minutes, 5 hours, or 5 days? It forces prioritization in real time.</em>**</p><div><hr></div><h2>5. Operational Oversight: Tracking Progress with Clarity</h2><p>Success isn’t about doing more—it’s about knowing where you stand and what needs to happen next. Keeping a clear view of your ongoing projects and responsibilities helps ensure nothing important falls through the cracks.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check the status of each priority.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Identify the next step to move each forward.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Use a simple color system to track progress:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Green</strong> = Progressing with an actionable plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> = Falling behind but still has a clear next step.</p></li><li><p><strong>Red</strong> = Behind and no actionable plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Black</strong> = On hold indefinitely.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>**<em>Quick Hack: Follow the <strong>One Next Step Rule.</strong> Instead of tracking massive to-do lists, write the one next step for each project. If there’s no clear step, the task isn’t actionable yet.</em>**</p><div><hr></div><h2>6. Plan to Take a Break: Operational Readiness Requires Recovery</h2><p>Here’s something I wish I’d learned earlier in my career: <strong>you don’t have to earn rest. You just need to take it.</strong></p><p>Early in my career, I fell into the trap of believing that working through exhaustion was a sign of strength. I skipped meals, worked through the night, and thought I could outpace the chaos. I was wrong.</p><p><em>**Quick Hack: Implement a <strong>Shutdown Ritual.</strong> Set a fixed “work cutoff time” and spend 5 minutes writing down what you’ll tackle tomorrow. It signals your brain to disengage.**</em></p><p>Take time to reset. Protect your cognitive bandwidth for what truly matters.</p><div><hr></div><h3>A Question for You:</h3><p>What one thing from this article can you try this week? Let me know in the comments or reply directly—I’d love to hear what works for you!</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Don’t optimize for today—optimize for repeatability. A system like Operational Oversight isn’t just about managing today’s workload; it’s about ensuring that tomorrow and next week run smoothly as well.</p></li><li><p>Your brain already triages tasks—you just have to listen. We instinctively know what’s important, but modern work cultures train us to ignore our intuition in favor of urgency bias. A structured system like live triage forces a return to natural prioritization.</p></li><li><p>*Bonus* <strong>Mental clutter is more dangerous than physical clutter.</strong> A disorganized workspace might slow you down, but an unfiltered to-do list actively sabotages decision-making by creating false urgency and decision fatigue.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Book – </strong><em><strong>Make Time</strong></em><strong> by Jake Knapp &amp; John Zeratsky</strong> – A practical guide on structuring your day around what truly matters, rather than getting lost in endless tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tool – </strong><em><strong>The Pomodoro Technique</strong></em> – Helps enforce deep work by breaking your day into focused sprints, preventing task overflow and burnout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concept – </strong><em><strong>"Energy Management Over Time Management"</strong></em><strong> by Tony Schwartz</strong> – The idea that managing your energy levels (sleep, breaks, mental focus) is more important than just optimizing for efficiency.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p>In the last week, what’s one task that didn’t move the needle? How will you prevent tasks like that from creeping into your workflow?</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
