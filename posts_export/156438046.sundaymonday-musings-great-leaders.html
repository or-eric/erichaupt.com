<p>Happy <s>Sunday</s> Monday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! As promised, here is a Monday 1 quote I’m musing on this, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”</p><p> | Proverb from Burkina Faso</p><div><hr></div><p>A few nights ago, I was speaking with a friend of mine, we’ll call him Tom. Tom is an exceptional leader I had worked with on a complex, high-stakes project a few years back. He has recently been promoted to a program manager role, responsible for several project leaders who, in turn, led their own teams. It’s a significant step up, a testament to his ability.</p><p>Tom is brilliant, highly competent, and deeply committed to his mission. Yet, despite his experience, he was exhausted.</p><p>The weight of responsibility wasn’t the problem. He thrived under pressure. What was breaking him was the feeling of being the sole person who truly understood the strategic vision. He found himself drowning in details—making (or, rather, struggling to find) the time to make all the tactical decisions his project leads should have been handling, constantly course-correcting initiatives that veered off track, and being the only one who could articulate the bigger picture.</p><p>He was delegating tasks. He had people in leadership positions, but they weren’t proactively working through friction points. They weren’t communicating his vision effectively to their teams. Instead of cascading intent downward, they were merely executing orders.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Whether you’re leading a military unit, a cybersecurity task force, or an executive team, your success isn’t defined by how much you can personally accomplish. It’s defined by how well the trusted leaders around you understand, own, and drive the vision forward.</p><p>History is filled with leaders who understood the importance of a trusted inner circle.</p><p>• Julius Caesar had his legates—trusted generals like Mark Antony who carried his strategic intent across the Roman legions.</p><p>• General Eisenhower didn’t win World War II by managing every battle—he relied on leaders like Patton and Montgomery to take ownership of their theaters and execute decisively.</p><p>• Elon Musk doesn’t personally engineer every Tesla or SpaceX rocket—he sets the vision, and his senior leaders make it reality.</p><p>What all these leaders understood is this: True leadership isn’t about control. It’s about clarity and trust.</p><p>If your leaders can’t own the vision, your entire operation slows down. Instead of leaders making decisions aligned with your intent, they constantly come back for clarification. Instead of pushing the mission forward, they hesitate, waiting for direction.</p><p>So, how do we build a team of leaders who don’t just follow orders but fully own and drive our strategic vision? It comes down to three key principles:</p><p>1. <strong>Clarity of Vision: The Leadership North Star</strong></p><p>If you asked each of your direct reports to articulate your mission in a single sentence, would they all say the same thing?</p><p>If not, you have a communication problem.</p><p>A leader’s vision should be like the North Star—visible, unwavering, and guiding everything the team does. Your inner circle should not only understand this vision but be able to communicate it with the same conviction and precision that you do.</p><p>Actionable Nudge:At your next meeting, go around the room and ask each team member:</p><p>“If I were not here, how would you explain our mission to someone new?”</p><p>If their answers vary, you have work to do. Alignment starts with clarity, and clarity starts with communication.</p><p>2. <strong>Trust and Decentralized Decision-Making</strong></p><p>The strongest teams don’t just execute tasks; they make decisions as if they were the leader themselves. This requires trust—not just in their competence but in their judgment.</p><p>The best military units function under Commander’s Intent—the principle that leaders at every level should understand the overarching mission so well that they can make independent decisions in the heat of battle. The same applies to high-functioning cybersecurity teams and corporate leadership structures.</p><p>If your direct reports constantly need approval before acting, they aren’t truly leading—they’re just managing tasks.</p><p>Your job is to equip them with the insight, confidence, and trust to take ownership.</p><p>Actionable Nudge: The next time someone brings you a decision to make, instead of giving them an answer, ask: “If I were unavailable, what decision would you make, and why?”</p><p>Then, empower them to make it. This is how you shift from a dependency culture to an ownership culture.</p><p>3. <strong>Vision Cascading: Leaders Building Leaders</strong></p><p>Your direct reports aren’t just there to understand and execute your vision—they are there to amplify it.</p><p>If they aren’t effectively communicating the vision, the why, and the end state to their teams, then alignment erodes at every level of the organization. The message becomes diluted. Silos form. People work in different directions, possibly while believing they’re aligned.</p><p>Your job isn’t just to lead your inner circle; it’s to help them lead theirs.</p><p>Actionable Nudge: Ask your key leaders: “What have you done this week to reinforce our mission with your team?”</p><p>If they struggle to answer, they aren’t communicating your vision enough. Great leaders don’t assume alignment—they encourage and reinforce it constantly.</p><p>In a crisis—like a major ransomware attack—there’s no time for top-down decision-making. If every choice has to go up the chain, response time suffers. Instead, the best security teams operate under a shared understanding of priorities, risks, and objectives.</p><p>Whether in battle, cyber defense, or business, the lesson is the same: A well-led team should be able to function as if you weren’t there.</p><p>If you disappeared tomorrow, what would happen to your mission?</p><p>Would your team struggle, unsure of the next steps? Or would they carry on seamlessly, because they truly own the vision? Great leaders don’t just execute strategies—they create leaders who can carry those strategies forward.</p><p>Ultimately, leadership isn’t about what we can do alone. It’s about what our team can achieve collectively.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>The moment you stop being the only one who understands the vision is the moment you start leading - Many believe their value comes from being the sole visionary, but true leadership happens when others can articulate and drive the mission without you.</p></li><li><p>Trust isn’t given to those who need oversight, it’s given to those who remove it - The best leaders don’t require constant check-ins; they create clarity and ownership</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Nvidia <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/blueprints">Blueprints</a> is a fun repo for pre-defined, customizable AI workflows designed to let us play around and help in creating and deploying generative AI applications and automations.</p></li><li><p>SpaceX’s rocket burst into pieces just minutes after launch last week. Elon Musk didn’t seem to mind though, posting a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1880040599761596689">clip</a> of the debris tumbling through the atmosphere quipping "Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!". </p></li><li><p>Want to know more about DeepSeek before touching it? (Hint, don’t give them your info) Here’s a <a href="https://trite-song-d6a.notion.site/Deepseek-R1-for-Everyone-1860af77bef3806c9db5e5c2a256577d">guide</a> does a good job of explaining the R1 paper in detail for those who want to learn more about the model.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p>Who are the three people in your current circle that you trust implicitly to carry forward your vision? If you don’t have three, who should they be?</p><p>Lead with Intent, Build with Trust</p><p>If this resonated with you, share it with someone who needs to hear it. And if you have thoughts on how you’ve built your own inner circle, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s keep the conversation going.</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
