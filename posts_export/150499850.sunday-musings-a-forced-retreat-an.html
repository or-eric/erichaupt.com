<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Back home in Augusta and still no internet. Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way”</p><p>-Marcus Aurelius</p><div><hr></div><h3>No Streaming, No Internet Makes Eric…Something Something…</h3><p>The last three weeks without internet access at home have provided an unexpected opportunity to reflect on one of the core ideas from Stoic philosophy, particularly Marcus Aurelius’ insight that “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p><p>What at first seemed like an inconvenience—a sudden disconnect from the internet—has revealed itself as a chance to explore how such obstacles can shape our focus, refine our perspective, and bring opportunities to improve ourselves. This obstacle is no longer just a frustration but an avenue for self-improvement, productivity, and reflection.</p><p>Drawing from this idea, it’s clear that the Stoics had an approach to obstacles that goes beyond simply enduring them. They saw obstacles as a catalyst for growth. Seneca wrote, “Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body,” reminding us that the challenges we face are not just things to get past but are essential to building resilience and mental strength.</p><p>Similarly, Epictetus said that “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality,” urging us to reconsider how much of our frustration comes from our own expectations and mental resistance rather than the actual situation. In my case, the real challenge was less the lack of internet itself and more the attachment I had to a certain way of working and connecting.</p><p>Philosophy teaches us that control is key. Not control over external circumstances—because we often don’t have that—but control over our own responses. This perspective echoes one of the most critical distinctions in Stoicism: the dichotomy of control. Epictetus emphasized that while we may not control what happens to us, we can always control how we respond. By focusing on what’s within our power, we can turn even the most frustrating situations into something productive.</p><p>Without easy access to my beloved internet, I’m forced to rethink how I engage with the world, focusing on the tools I do have—books, offline resources, and the ability to think more deeply without distraction (writing on paper, then in word and saving it, then pasting into Substack and LinkedIn). It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by what we can’t do when technology is stripped away, but there’s also freedom in it. Marcus Aurelius himself often reflected on the beauty of simplicity: “Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.” The moment we strip away what we think we need, we are left with the core of what’s truly important.</p><p>This situation also stripped away more than just the internet—it meant no television, no radio, no streaming. Initially, this felt like another major disruption, but it quickly opened a door to something I hadn’t realized I was missing: the joy of reading to my family. With the twins, we’ve rediscovered the simple pleasure of sharing stories together. Currently, we’re reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to them, and it is easily a new cherished part of our evenings. It’s a reminder that while technology offers convenience, it also crowds out those slower, more meaningful activities that build connection and presence. The time spent reading to my family deepens a bond in ways that constant entertainment can’t.</p><p>It’s important to acknowledge that the modern world revolves around technology and connectivity, and much of our work depends on these tools. This is where a blend of Stoicism and modern perspectives comes in. Robert Greene often writes about turning disadvantages into advantages. In The 48 Laws of Power, he speaks about “using absence to increase respect and honor,” turning moments of withdrawal into opportunities for others to miss you, and for you to cultivate inner strength. While this may not apply directly to being without the internet, the principle stands—absence can be an opportunity. In my case, stepping away from the constant stream of information has allowed space for deeper thought, creative problem-solving, and focus on long-term projects (foreshadowing?).</p><p>&nbsp;In The Obstacle Is the Way, Ryan Holiday expands on Marcus Aurelius’ philosophy by focusing on the idea that obstacles force us to innovate. He writes, “It’s in these moments—when we are most frustrated and ready to give up—that we are closest to a breakthrough.” This lack of internet has given me the space to reflect on the areas of my life that need more attention: the ideas I’ve been sitting on, the books I’ve been meaning to read, and the chance to think without distraction. It has shifted my attention from the urgency of immediate tasks to the importance of foundational work.</p><p>One surprising perspective on this situation comes from Epicurean philosophy. While often seen in opposition to Stoicism, the Epicureans also had valuable insights into how to live a fulfilling life. Epicurus himself noted, “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.” This idea ties in perfectly with the Stoic theme of contentment. The lack of internet, while frustrating, is a minor issue in the larger picture of life. It forces us to realize how fortunate we are to have such connectivity in the first place and to focus on the present moment rather than constantly longing for what’s missing.</p><p>This period of time has helped reinforce the importance of shifting from urgency to priority. Often, the constant connectivity that we rely on comes with its own form of mental clutter—emails, notifications, endless distractions. By being forced to slow down, I’ve been able to focus on tasks that truly matter, uninterrupted. The absence of internet has become a gift, in a sense, that has allowed me to recalibrate my mind, much like how Marcus Aurelius would retreat to his personal reflections in his Meditations to find clarity amid the chaos of ruling an empire.</p><p>The joy of reading with my family has reinforced another key aspect of this philosophy: obstacles often reveal what’s truly valuable. Without the distractions of television or streaming, our evening can be been filled with storytelling, laughter, and shared imagination. It’s a reminder that even in the most technologically advanced age, the simplest pleasures bring the greatest fulfillment.</p><p>As Seneca wisely put it, “Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.” In facing obstacles, no matter how mundane, we develop the courage to find new paths, create new habits, and become better versions of ourselves. The obstacle truly has become the way.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Finding the lesson in the act, in the event is often all you need to make something of it.</p></li><li><p>Care less about the speed of progress, more about scaling the right mountain.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory |  Roald Dahl</p></li><li><p>My neighbor’s truck.
