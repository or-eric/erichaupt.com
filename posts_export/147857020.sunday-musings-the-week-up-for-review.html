<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Here you’ll find 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p>“I will keep constant watch over myself and—most usefully—will put each day up for review. For this is what makes us evil—that none of us looks back upon our own lives. We reflect upon only that which we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future descend from the past,”</p><p>- Seneca</p><div><hr></div><p>I came out of this past week drained. It’s rare I finish a week “just done”. When it happens, putting it up for review is important for me. I’ve talked about it before, and I figure this is an opportunity to document the practice.</p><p><br>What went well?<br>What needs improvement?<br>What made you feel drained?<br>What can you learn from that?<br>How can you implement for the future?</p><p>I had a lot of things go well, the team and I accomplished all of our goals, improved some processes, upgraded some goals. There were a few friction points that I would dub energy vampires. They sucked the energy right out of me. Because I let them, people and things can only make you feel poorly/inferior/negatively (for longer than the immediate) without your consent, right?</p><p>Ok, I’ve identified what went well. I’ve noted the things that need improvement and how they made me feel drained. Time to learn. </p><p>How do we learn? We speak with the dead. Also known as researching writings from those who’ve been there, done that, and wrote about their successes and failures.</p><h3>Control over your Feelings vs Control over your Actions</h3><p>Many think Stoicism is all about not having or suppressing feelings. I don’t think that’s what they were saying it all. It’s about observing, evaluating, and understanding those feelings. </p><p>It’s ok to feel the feelings in the moment. The important thing is how you respond to those feelings. </p><p>WHY do I feel this way? Am I actually harmed or am I simply having an emotional response?</p><p>Take a moment to make sure you understand.</p><p>Ryan Holiday turned me on to a story about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU7H_KbjV4">Golfer Brandon Mathews</a>’ reaction to a fan yelping during his putt to get him into the Open. It was an important putt. It was one of his first shots at getting in.</p><p>Naturally, in the moment he was pretty upset when the yelp distracted him during his backswing, and he missed the putt.</p><p>But he found out the rest of the story. The fan had Downs Syndrome and was so excited to see him that he couldn’t keep it in anymore.</p><p>Brandon went to find the fan and signed an autograph for him, gave him a hug and turned a very negative event for him into a positive one for everyone in the vicinity.</p><h3>“Until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly” - Epictetus</h3><p>The guy who just no call/no showed you for a meeting? He possibly just received news that he has cancer and is dealing with that. </p><p>That parent who is letting their child cry in public? What if you knew newborns don’t produce melatonin, and also don’t have a developed circadian rhythm yet and they’re taking the baby out at times to help them regulate hormones despite their own exhaustion?</p><p>What is their situation? If you don’t know, make a practice of empathy. Assume there’s a reason that has nothing to do with you and it was an accidental affront. As Socrates says, “Almost no one does wrong on purpose”.</p><p>Or, in Matthew’s case, maybe they don’t know better.</p><p>Or, unlike you and I, maybe they “Don’t understand the difference between good and evil” as Marcus Aurelius would say. </p><p>The point is to take a beat to reign in the anger and consider their reasons.</p><h3>“Losing our Temper is a Luxury” - Ryan Holiday</h3><p>Ryan sent an <a href="https://dailystoic.com/losing-your-temper-is-a-luxury/">awesome email</a> out about this specific topic. </p><p>Somehow, we are able to keep calm during crises and yet explode during mundane events. Like when the internet is slow, we rage against the gods. But when it is legitimately out, we just go outside and get some other work done. Or, in Ryan’s example, we scratch our knee our pain receptors light up, but if our arm had been torn off, our nervous system would protect us.</p><p>We have the ability to maintain our composure in life and death situations, even comfort or help others when the mistake is monumental. If we can stay calm then, then we have the power to not partake in the luxury of losing our cool when the stakes are low, and the misstep is minor. </p><p>OK to have snap feelings/emotions/judgements</p><p>What matters is what you DO next.</p><p>Brandon Mathews is an amazing example of this. Rather than acting out on his initial emotions, he made sure he understood the situation, then he acted with kindness instead of anger. He created a keynote in sportsmanship for golf.</p><p>That single moment, in spite of his loss, showed who he was. An ambassador of the sport and a true sportsman. That moment also showed the PGA what their golfers should be, and they offered him a spot in his first PGA tour event.</p><h3>Looking at the Larger Picture</h3><p>Now, in a time of world unrest, persistent conflict, divisive politics.</p><p>Why assume noble intent?<br>Why care about civil rights?<br>Why look beyond partisan and political tribalism?<br>Why push aside enmity, pessimism?</p><p>Because “they”, because “them”, because the other side is made up of our neighbors and as Marcus said, they are us.</p><p>Anger is something for all of us to manage ourselves. </p><p>To do good, acts for the common good. That’s all that matters. (Even when the act is simply holding in that angry act until you have a better understanding).</p><p>And if that person does turn out to be simply mean spirited, what good will it do you to become one also? To push that onto the next undeserving person? To degrade yourself and make you worse by responding in kind?</p><p>As the Stoics would say, the best revenge is to not be like them.</p><p>Will you have to shoulder a lot of rudeness and undeserved hits? Yeah. But we have our own race to run. We cannot let them throw us off our game.</p><p>-e</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Other people’s mistakes are their problems. They aren’t yours, nor are they within your control. What is in your control is how you learn from your own mistakes and the situations that arise when others make their own mistakes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bullet Journaling + Get Things Done (GTD) Methodology + PARA System.</strong> I love my digital system. But I spend so much time in areas where I can’t use my personal technology and systems that it makes it ineffective and inefficient. So, I’ve begun modifying these two ideas to something that fits my style in a pen and paper system that’s portable, effective, efficient, and (of course) easy to keep using. I’m using a small journal for capturing daily notes and tasks, an 11x17 artist’s sketchpad as the framework for maintaining areas of effort (one page per), and projects (columns within the page). </p><ol><li><p>I segment the journal into my projects, then capture all my daily to dos, tasks, and notes in the small journal (bullet style).</p></li><li><p>At the end of the day, I’ll review the segments and transcribe them into the projects on the 11x17 projects and areas, clarifying the original notes and organizing them. Then I can create actionable and prioritized steps forward and for the next day.</p></li><li><p>Using a fountain pen because there’s something awesome about fountain pens. </p></li></ol></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://thedankoe.com/">Dan Koe</a> | Dan has been cranking out piece after piece with a great blueprint on being a “Solopreneur”. Specifically, I’ve enjoyed his take on Conceptual Survival.  </p><div class="pullquote"><p><em><strong>Conceptual survival:</strong> The human phenomenon where our survival instincts have transcended the physical realm and are included in the mental. We work to survive ideas, concepts, and beliefs that form our sense of self.</em></p></div><p>Essentially, our perceptions of our problems trigger fight or flight responses. We have these genetically wired responses to things that aren’t supposed to trigger them.</p></li><li><p>“Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.” | John Gardner</p></li><li><p>“In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.” | Eric Hoffer</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>Like our golfer, what impediment to your life this week is an opportunity for you to make a beautiful choice, to use it as fuel for the fire of your ambitious engine?</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
