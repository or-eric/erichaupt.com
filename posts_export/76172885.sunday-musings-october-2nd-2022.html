Most importantly, how are we prepared to “deal with change, learn new things, and preserve your mental balance in unfamiliar situations”?</p><p>​<em><strong>21 Lessons for the</strong></em><strong> 21st Century, </strong>by <a href="https://amzn.to/3UV2eRW">Yuval Noah Harari</a>. Yuval poignantly highlights our biggest challenges as modern humans while positing solutions as we reach a technological and societal inflection point.  Essentially, if we don’t shoulder our responsibility to be informed peoples today and actively shape tomorrow, we will end up with a class of peoples largely obsolete in their ability to work as their jobs have been automated.  If we are unable to adapt and reteach ourselves how to learn (learn to learn?), then we could find ourselves diminished in our ability to make choices for ourselves and forfeit those choices to technologies.</p><h2><strong>Technology I’m Looking At</strong></h2><h3>iPhone or Pixel?</h3><p>It’s phone time here, I’m seriously deliberating between the iPhone 14 and the Pixel 7. I’ve been a long-time Pixel owner; since the first.  I’ve loved it, but I’m entering a phase of my life where I’m hoping to become a content maker (hence the newsletter and blog).  All the brilliant people around me in this sphere use an Apple ecosystem and I’ve got…. FOMO?  I swapped from the Surface to the iPad Pro and it’s been wonderful, iOS has really become snappy and useful compared to my initial foray with the first models.  Thoughts?  Shoot me a DM @erichaupt or email me long form at eric@erichaupt.com.</p><h2>Productivity Apps</h2><h3>Just pick one…or two…or ten</h3><p>Holy cow. As I’m starting up this content creator thing and my business startup with my friends, I’m learning, and reading, and researching.  I’m currently walking through Tiago Forte’s <em>Building a Second Brain</em>.  I love the concept of C.O.D.E; and I think I’ll do a quick and dirty either blog post (maybe my first video?) with my take.  But I have so many questions.  As I mentioned before, I just hopped on the iPad bandwagon, so I have a foot in both PC/Android and Apple/iOS camps.  Which means I’m unlimited in my options.  Which means I’m being less productive because I’m doing all this “research on the best instead of just picking one.  @Tiago, if you read this, I could use your thoughts.  </p><p>I’m thinking about just going with some combination of Apple Notes (quick on the iPad) and Notion for note taking (iOS, Android, and Windows) for my quick not taking, Notion as my repository of all knowledge, and then finding other things.</p><p>Bottom line, there are a ton of options and just as many people with opinions on them. I just need to stick to my first plan.  Thoughts?</p><h2>Quote I’m Musing About</h2><p><strong>“Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands? You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.”</strong></p><p>-<a href="https://amzn.to/3Cs5vkw">Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</a></p><p>This rings true in much of my readings and study over the past week.  I’ve used this as a lens when I read about the work from home movement and the post-pandemic societal changes. I think one of the most important things we can do as leaders, as professionals, as parents, as humans, is take time to think and reflect.  Maybe the pandemic has given many of us time to think about what we really want in and out of life. Perhaps just doing what you love will organically make you more efficient and productive?  I think I’m going to put my thoughts together on this one and make a separate content block.</p><p>I would love your feedback! Which musing is your favorite? What else do you want to see or what should I eliminate? Any other suggestions? Please let me know. Just send a tweet to @erichaupt on Twitter and put #SundayMusings at the end so I can find it.  Or, eric@erichaupt.com for long form email. <br>​<br>Have a wonderful week, I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg" width="170" height="118.74313186813187" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:170,&quot;bytes&quot;:40964,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iLKL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc13d0ca-d656-425b-a10b-552e3a24dc8d_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Forwarded this Musing?
