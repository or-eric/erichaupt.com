How would you really enjoy spending your life?”</strong></p><p>-Alan Watts</p><p>I stumbled upon a recording of the philosopher Alan Watts discussing this question a couple months ago. I saved it in my Zettle Kasten as a powerful quote and tried to tuck it away in my box of forgetfulness. The questions hurt and startled me. I didn’t, and don’t have a good answer. There’s the typical “nothing”, “relax”, “spend time with family” automatic responses, but nothing of substance came immediately. I argue that this simple question will, likely, paralyze even the best of us. It forces us to take such a macro view as to no longer just see the big picture but attempt at the whole picture - Our life.</p><p>I’ve asked a similar question “Would you keep doing this job if you won the lottery/suddenly were a millionaire?” to those seniors around me. The preponderance said either “No” or “Absolutely Not”. The rest said they’d either do it part time or at much reduced hours. The interesting part is when followed up with “why not go part time or quit now?” The response was, unerringly, a variation of “I need the money”.</p><p> I’ve seen others write about this seeming thought trap, and I know I don’t want to be in this position where I’m only doing something because of the money. My goal has and continues to be to do something I truly enjoy.</p><p>Which is where I find myself today, and amusing (read: frustrating) paradoxical cycle. If money were no object, is this what I’d really be doing? Is this how I would <em>actually</em> choose to spend my time, that uniquely non-renewable resource? What if I sit down and rethink this from years ago-if I won the lottery, would I continue to push down this current track, Military leader in Cyber operations and capability development, on-call advisor/advocate, and nights and weekends researcher/writer/creator?</p><p>It’s a question I’ve been thinking on quite a bit.</p><p>If I was suddenly so wealthy that money meant nothing, I’d still do it. But I’d do it on <em><strong>my terms</strong></em>. I very much enjoy the realms I get to traverse. The dichotomy blending military rigidity, the fluidity of cyber and technology, and the art of leadership and problem solving across the gamut of persons in the field is something I haven’t seen anywhere else.</p><p>It’s having to communicate complicated problems simply for experts to utter beginners in applying cyber concepts to more traditional practices. But those same people are absolute experts in their fields and crafts. It’s challenging, rewarding, frustrating, and enjoyable.</p><p>What I enjoy most is creation. Not like “I’m a content creator/youtuber/personality” so much as the creating of things, capabilities, tactics, techniques, procedures, <strong>tradecraft</strong>, and being able to travel the myriad microcosms in those fields of experts, pairing talent with capability and need; then coming out on the other side of a focused effort to see our team create something that brings about an inflection point in how organizations operate and train.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I love writing; I’ll eventually make time to do some videos when I stop being such a chicken. But of all the things I’ve ever done, heading up the capability requirements and development of a major platform is something that always makes me smile.</p><p>That’s what I’d do.</p><p>“So, what’s stopping you, Eric, from just doing that?”</p><p>Money. It’s Money.</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Yes, I can change careers; I’d probably land something that pays well. But I still love many aspects of what I do, especially helping others achieve their goals. I also think it’s highly dependent on what stage of life you’re at.</p><p>If I was in my twenties, I’d jump all over the same advice I give those I mentor.</p><p>I wasn’t in a place where I needed to worry too much about work-life balance (although it’s always important), and I could hustle/grind both simultaneously and enjoy it.</p><p>But then there’s conflicting advice to think about. “What got you here won’t keep you here or get you there (there being the next step).” We must adapt, take in the experiences and knowledge and apply them again to evolve.</p><p>This year-long endeavor has become a habit, and a catharsis. </p><p>It’s also helped me realize that my “just grind” and follow the path forward that I started on stopped working for me years ago and no longer serves me in living that balanced, fulfilling life. I mean, heck, I started off convinced I was going to be a cinematographer. At some point that strategy changed, for the better. Two Services, three occupational specialties, operations, and deeply bespoke endeavors. </p><p>I’m not entirely sure what the implications of this realization session is, but it’s something I’m going to figure out…and likely write about.</p><p>In the interim, check out the question this week. Let me know what you would do if money were no object.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Sometimes we feel misunderstood, like people just don’t get what we’re about.</p><blockquote><p>“We are the only people who know our thoughts and feelings.
