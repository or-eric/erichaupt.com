<p>Happy Sunday Friend!</p><p>Greetings from Washington DC! I’m traveling for a symposium and loving the energy of meeting so many new people!</p><p>Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p><strong>“Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach”</strong></p><p>-Seneca</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack in this quote, and I love the complexity. The short of it is to find mentors and be a mentor; we’ll learn from both. </p><p>Like I said yesterday, I’m in Washington DC for a professional event. There are thousands of people here who are experts at various facets of Electronic Warfare and the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Individuals who have spent decades <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/erichaupt/p/sunday-musings-building-the-t?r=1r1zns&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">building their “T” or “M”</a> coming together to share knowledge; both teaching and learning from each other.</p><h4>On Having Mentors</h4><p>Without a doubt, I’m a fan of the self-reflection aspects of stoicism. Turning into ourselves and examining our thoughts, our feelings, and our actions yields great understanding of how we work. But it’s also about community.</p><p>Find those who have built (or are farther along than us) a deep understanding and knowledge in a subject and learning from their log study. Or, find those who’s outlook, temperament, and nature are aspirational to you and begin to model those successful elements, learning as you do.</p><p>Emerson also talks how ever person he meets is his superior in something and learns from them.</p><p>A great problem-solving construct is to envision how a person (real or fictional) with the traits and qualities suited for the situation would respond to a situation and use that ideal construct to shape your reaction.</p><p>I worked with a guy, Nick, who has an amazing temperament and nature about him where he’s easy to talk to and inquisitive without inciting defensiveness in others. All the while, he’s demonstrably brilliant. On many occasions I’ve asked myself how he’d respond to a certain situation and then do that. It’s a way of getting distance and a change in perspective from a situation.</p><h4>On Being a Mentor</h4><p>Our impact on others is surprisingly large. </p><p>We don’t get to chose to become a mentor. We are chosen; we can only accept or decline. For me, the answer is always yes. </p><p>Refer back to Emerson’s quote; if someone values you and is honestly attempting to improve, you’ll both learn, evolve, and benefit from the relationship.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Mastery is expressing the complex simply.<br></p></li><li><p>If you ask the question, you’re only ignorant for a moment. If you don’t, you’re ignorant for a lifetime.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/hVCBrkrFrBE?si=YvwI-ttGMGhmYleT">Lollipop Leadership</a> - </strong>I’ve referred to this before, Drew Dudley has a great story about how leadership happens everyday. Often we think about leadership and mentorship as world-shaking singular events. But more often, they’re little things that we may not even notice; and (if we’re lucky) someone will tell us about it later  | <a href="https://youtu.be/hVCBrkrFrBE?si=YvwI-ttGMGhmYleT">More</a></p></li><li><p>“When you counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of something he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see.”  Baltasar Gracian, excerpt from <em>The Art of Worldly Wisdom</em> | <a href="https://amzn.to/47PdHZi">More</a></p></li><li><p>“There are two ways of spreading light: To be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.” - <strong>Edith Wharton</strong>, excerpt from Vesalius in Zante | <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25119328">More</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>What is something you want to be great at and who can you surround yourself with that will help you be great?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Shoot Me Your Feedback!</h2><p>Which is your favorite? What else do you want to see or what should I eliminate? Any other suggestions? Just send a tweet to @erichaupt on Twitter and put #SundayMusings at the end so I can find it.
