<p>Happy Sunday Friends!</p><p>Here's one quote I'm musing on this week, two core ideas, three favorite things, and one question to carry with you into the week ahead.</p><div><hr></div><h2>One Quote I'm Musing</h2><p><em>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure."</em> | Marianne Wiliamson</p><div><hr></div><p>I’m standing at the edge of a new role—one that mirrors the work I’ve loved doing in the Army, but in a different, more prominent way.</p><p>More public. More forward-facing. More visible.</p><p>It’s a good thing. A next-level opportunity. But I’ll be honest with you—</p><p>I’m anxious.</p><p>Not because I don’t trust my ability. But because stepping into this role means stepping <em>out</em> of the version of me that’s been comfortable, proven, and safe.</p><p>It’s not fear of failure I’m facing.</p><p>It’s fear of <em>expansion, transition</em>.</p><h2>😨 The Fear of Becoming</h2><p>Most of us fear not doing enough. But what happens when we fear <em>doing well</em>?</p><p>What if we actually become what we said we wanted?</p><p>That’s where resistance lives, I know it does for me.<br>Not in failure—but in <em>becoming so visible, so responsible, so powerful</em> that there’s no turning back.</p><p>I’ve noticed something:</p><p>The closer we get to becoming the version of ourselves we admire, the louder the voice gets that says:<br>“Are you sure ?”</p><p>That voice isn’t truth. It’s memory.<br>It’s your nervous system remembering the comfort of who you were—and panicking at the thought of losing it.</p><h2>🪞 Grieving the Old Identity</h2><p>I had a ton of time this weekend to really think on these feelings.</p><p>One thought really struck a chord:</p><blockquote><p>“I don’t think I’m afraid of the new role. I think I’m grieving the old one.”</p></blockquote><p>That’s it.</p><p>That past version of me—the one who operated from the background, refined ideas out of the spotlight, led in quiet spaces—that version <em>served</em> me. I broadened without perceptible risk.</p><p>But I can’t take him into this next season.</p><p>Transitions are hard not because we don’t want the future. They’re hard because we haven’t made peace with the past.</p><p>To evolve, we have to <em>let go without rejecting</em>.<br>The goal isn’t to kill your old identity; it’s to integrate it into something more complete.</p><h2>🎭 The Paradox of Arrival</h2><p>You see, no one tells you that the moment you <em>arrive</em> at something you’ve worked toward is the same moment you question whether you belong there.</p><p>It’s not imposter syndrome.<br>It’s <strong>identity lag</strong>.</p><p>You’re not unqualified, you’re just unfamiliar with this new version of you. That’s why it feels like fraudulence.</p><p>The solution isn’t to wait for confidence.<br>It’s to <em>act as if</em>—to operate like the version of you who already lives there.</p><blockquote><p>Greene tell us: <em>Every transformation has a cost. The old you must be paid forward.<br></em>Holiday would remind us: <em>The obstacle isn’t the fear. The obstacle is the attachment.<br></em>I think <em>The easiest way to close the gap is to live like your future self in 10-minute blocks.</em></p></blockquote><h2>🔑 The Key Insight</h2><p>We don’t need to erase the past version of ourselves.<br>But we do need to stop asking for their permission.</p><p>Act from your future.<br>Lead from the self you're becoming, not the one you're comfortable being.</p><h2>🛠️ Identity Shift Toolkit</h2><p>So, if you’re a bit like me—handsome, dashing, occasionally anxious—here’s an Identity Integration Protocol for the season of transition:</p><p><strong>The Identity Integration Protocol</strong></p><p>🔍 <strong>Name the Old Identity<br>  </strong>Write it down: “I was someone who _______.”<br>  What did that version of you value, avoid, fear?</p><p>🪞 <strong>Define the New Identity</strong><br>  Write: “I’m becoming someone who _______.”<br>  What actions reflect that? What would that version of you do <em>today</em>?</p><p>⚖️ <strong>Create an Overlap Habit</strong><br>Pick one behavior from the old version of you and pair it with a new one. Do both 30 days. It becomes a <em>bridg</em>e, not a break.</p><p>⏱️ <strong>Use the 10-Minute Rehearsal</strong><br>Set a timer. For 10 minutes, <em>work like future you would</em>.<br>Take the call, write the draft, lead the meeting.</p><p>Over time, those 10-minute shifts become the new you.</p><p>🎙️ <strong>Bonus: Practice Future Voice</strong><br>Record a 30-second memo as your future self. Describe your average day. Speak it into reality.</p><h2>💡 Two Ideas From Me</h2><p>🧠 <strong>It’s not fear of failing. It’s fear of losing the excuse not to grow.</strong><br>Because once you step forward, you can’t hide behind potential.</p><p>🧭<strong> Trust the people who believe in you.</strong><br>Let your identity align with your impact.</p><h2>Three Favorite Things This Week</h2><p>🎧 <strong>Podcast</strong>: Lex Fridman × Rick Rubin on creative identity, authenticity, and transformation | <a href="https://youtu.be/H_szemxPcTI?si=QVwvB2gt5TbVK9G5">Listen</a><br>  🎯 Start at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_szemxPcTI&amp;t=1140s">19:00</a> for my favorite 4-minute segment.<br><br>📖 <strong>Book</strong>: <em>The Mountain Is You</em> by Brianna Wiest — brilliant on self-sabotage, my favorite line is “Your new life is going to cost you your old one.” | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-You-Transforming-Self-Sabotage-Self-Mastery/dp/1949759229">Amazon</a><br><br>🎵 <strong>Song</strong>: “Brave” by Sara Bareilles — Feels cheesy, but 157m listeners…right?<br>| <a href="https://youtu.be/QUQsqBqxoR4?si=UEeHuDZ_5SvqTmP5">YouTube</a></p><h2>✍️ One Question to Take Into Your Week</h2><p><strong>What part of you is scared to grow—and what version of you is ready to take over?</strong></p><p>Write it down.<br>Thank the part that brought you here.<br>Then step forward.</p><p>If this resonated, send it to a friend standing on the edge of something new.<br>Sometimes what we need isn’t another answer—it’s knowing we’re not alone in the becoming.</p><div><hr></div><p>Until next Sunday, my friends.</p><p>Stay bold.
