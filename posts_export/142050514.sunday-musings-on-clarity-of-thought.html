<p>Happy Sunday Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h1>One Quote I’m Musing</h1><p><strong>“If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furious. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along, so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled—have you no shame in that?”</strong></p><p>-Epictetus, <em>Enchiridion</em></p><div><hr></div><p>We safeguard our physical space. No one touches us without consent, no one dictates where we go. However, a paradox arises in safeguarding our mind. </p><p>We're surprisingly less disciplined, willingly handing over control of influence and the traveling thought patterns to ever-scrolling feeds of social media, the ceaseless chatter of television and concern over what others think, do and say. At work, the intention to focus quickly succumbs to the allure of internet distractions. Family time is punctuated by the tap and glow of smartphones. Even in a park, we get caught up in analyzing those passing by rather than giving over to introspection.</p><p>What’s alarming is that we often don't realize our, self-inflicted cognitive invasion, nor do we fully grasp how inefficient and distracting it becomes. </p><p>Imagine this in cybersecurity. Entrusting our digital existence to random websites and unchecked sources, leaving our data exposed and vulnerable – a concept universally recognized as absurd.</p><p>The Stoics would condemn this as a contemporary atrocity. They understood that, while the world might influence our physical selves, our minds, our sense of identity, should remain our own. Protecting our mental sanctum is paramount. In our cybersecurity analogy, it's akin to recognizing the importance of securing our digital identities against external threats.</p><p>Guard your mind against the onslaught of entities vying for influence and control over your thoughts in this age of information, just as we safeguard personal data from malign actors in cyberspace. In this juxtaposition, Stoic philosophy meets our modern world, urging us to be vigilant guardians of our mind, our perceptions, and feelings. </p><p>-e</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Some assistance in making the right choices. As you consider what you should do, maintain a mental model of an indifferent spectator who witnesses your behavior at all times. They will, quietly, admonish you if you consider doing something selfish or dishonest. Conversely, they will bear witness to your selfless and virtuous acts.</p></li><li><p>Study is important. But go and <em><strong>live</strong></em> your life. It’s the only way you’ll truly understand what any of it means.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>“The people you surround yourself with influence your behaviors, so choose friends who have healthy habits.”  - Dan Buettner</p></li><li><p>“Think for yourself and do what’s right for you, but let others do the same.” - Matthew Quick</p></li><li><p>“I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.” - Mahatma Gandhi</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Question</strong></h2><p>Do you want to be recognized by the things you have or by your character?</p><div><hr></div><p>​Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg" width="248" height="173.22527472527472" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:248,&quot;bytes&quot;:40964,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wI1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa76c39d-38d6-4f42-ae05-d9c9a70c33fd_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
