<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! As promised, here is a Monday 1 quote I’m musing on this, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.”</p><p> | Seneca</p><div><hr></div><p>Last week, I found myself navigating the high-stakes corridors of Silicon Valley, where the future of Artificial Intelligence is being shaped in real-time. Over just a few short days, I got to engage with leaders and innovators at five of the biggest names in AI, each driven by distinct ambitions, priorities, and underlying motives. The conversations were a mix of inspiring, frustrating, and transformative. Some of engagements were productive, and went in directions very different to what we came in with. One was simply misaligned—our interests just didn't intersect in meaningful ways yet. But two of the meetings were fantastic. From the outset, we identified shared values, mutual goals, and points of excitement. The conversation felt effortless, and within minutes, we were brainstorming concrete ways to collaborate.</p><p>Reflecting on this resurfaced a fundamental truth: <strong>everyone has an agenda.</strong> And that’s neither good nor bad—it simply is. The value is in understanding this and working with it, not despite it or against it.</p><p>The key to working with diverse stakeholders—regardless of our field and strategy—is not to resist these agendas but to understand them, align where possible, and use them to build momentum. The Roman statesman Cicero once said, "We are all servants of our own interests." History shows us that the most successful collaborations occur not when agendas disappear, but when they intersect in meaningful ways. We don’t need to force agreement on everything. We only need to find enough common ground to create forward motion.</p><h3>Harmonizing Agendas: A Blueprint for Agenda Alignment</h3><p>Ever watched great leaders like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, or Satya Nadella and thought, 'How do they make collaboration look so effortless?' It’s not some innate superpower—it’s a learnable system. The secret? Understanding that differing agendas are puzzle pieces waiting to be placed correctly. They aren’t roadblocks. What's fantastic is when aligned, they don’t simply fit—they create something bigger, more powerful than any single element could achieve. Let’s talk about a simple but powerful way for bridging these gaps. Let’s make this super actionable. Here is a simple and easy-to apply five step method that help us navigate different motivations and turn competing interests into productive collaborations.</p><h4>🎯 Step 1: Find the Real Why (Not Just the What)</h4><p>Negotiations often stall because people focus on positions rather than interests. One side demands stricter regulations; the other pushes back against compliance burdens. But beneath those positions, both likely share the same fundamental concern: security and resilience.</p><p>💡 <strong>Try This:</strong> Next time you're in a negotiation, skip the formal stance and dig deeper. Ask, <em>'What’s the real driver behind their request?'</em> Often, inroads lie just beyond the resistance. Go beyond their stated position and look for their underlying interest.</p><h4>🗺️ Step 2: Seize the Common Ground</h4><p>Rarely will two parties have completely aligned objectives. Instead of trying to force a full agreement, focus on the overlap—what Venn diagram of shared interests exists?</p><p>In my sessions, I noticed that the most productive conversations started with alignment on just one or two key areas: a shared vision for responsible AI, a mutual desire for increased security in enterprise environments,  excitement around a specific breakthrough in agentics. Once that foundation was built, collaboration followed naturally.</p><p>📝 <strong>Try This:</strong> Forget winning every argument. Instead, sketch out two or three things you both agree on. Use that as jet fuel for collaboration.</p><h4>🤝 Step 3: Align yourself to a ‘We’re in This Together’ Mindset</h4><p>Marcus Aurelius wrote, <em>“What’s bad for the hive is bad for the bee.”</em> In other words, no one operates in isolation. Recognizing and embracing our interdependence fosters collaboration rather than competition.</p><p>In high-stakes environments like cybersecurity and AI governance, and many others, adopting this mindset shifts interactions from zero-sum battles to collective problem-solving. When people see that mutual success is possible, they become more willing to engage in meaningful dialogue.</p><p>🔄 <strong>Try This:</strong> Flip the conversation. Instead of focusing on your win, ask: <em>'How does their success actually help me too?'</em> You’ll be surprised at what you find.</p><h4>⚡ Step 4: See Resistance as an Opportunity</h4><p>It’s easy to see conflicting agendas as blockers. But physics teaches us that there's no traction without friction, and friction often signals where the most meaningful discussions need to happen.</p><p>If someone resists an idea, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re against you. they likely have valid concerns, blind spots, or constraints you haven’t considered. Instead of shutting down, lean into these moments.</p><p>🔍 <strong>Try This:</strong> The next time you hit resistance, pause. Instead of pushing harder, ask: <em>'What’s really behind this?'</em> Addressing hidden fears or constraints unlocks collaboration.</p><h4>🎛️ Step 5: Control What You Can, Let Go of What You Can’t</h4><p>Not every agenda can or should be changed. Some people will remain intractable. Some organizations will refuse to collaborate. That’s okay.</p><p>The Dichotomy of Control teaches us to separate what we control from what we don’t. We can’t control someone else’s agenda, but we can control how we engage, frame discussions, and look for alignment.</p><p>🔄 <strong>Try This:</strong> When stuck, take a breath and ask yourself: <em>'Am I trying to control something outside my reach?'</em> Redirect your energy to what you <em>can</em> influence.</p><p>Think about your own environment—whether in government, corporate security, or academia. Who are you currently struggling to work with? Where do misaligned agendas create friction? Now, ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>What core interest do they have that I haven’t fully considered?</p></li><li><p>Where is the overlap in our goals, even if it’s small?</p></li><li><p>How can I reframe our discussion to create mutual benefit?</p></li></ul><p>By harmonizing agendas with your collaborators, you’ll not only reduce conflict but unlock surprising opportunities for collaboration. The best partnerships don’t require full alignment—just enough shared ground to build something meaningful together. Try applying this framework in your next conversation—test it and refine it. Because in the end, progress isn’t about eliminating agendas—it’s about aligning them where it matters most.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Misalignment isn’t disagreement—it’s just unstructured collaboration.</p></li><li><p>Agendas don’t pull us apart; they shape the orbits we move in. Align the gravity, and momentum becomes effortless.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Pickle AI - Check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1igrqrg/this_guy_is_on_a_zoom_call_but_not_actually_in/">this video</a> of a Redditor testing out pickle. The results are amusing and the implications are entertaining for mandatory video on meetings.</p><p>| <a href="https://getpickle.ai/">More on Pickle AI</a></p></li><li><p>Lex Fridman posted an absolute banger of an interview session discussing everything from Agentic AI, to Nvidia, to TSMC, and National Security. Must watch! | <a href="https://youtu.be/_1f-o0nqpEI?si=Rxn9H9RFEmszTIin">Watch</a></p></li><li><p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">released an article</a> purporting that the U.K Issued an order last week for Apple to give its government access to cloud backups. If true, it will be an interesting conversation for why a government should have access to the information of persons who are not its citizens. | <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">More</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p>What’s one conversation in your work or life where misaligned agendas have created friction—and how can you turn that friction into forward momentum?</p><p>If this resonated with you, share it with someone and invite them into the conversation. I’d love to hear from you. Let’s keep the conversation going and build a network of thinkers who turn competing agendas into collective success.</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a wonderful week,</p><p>I’ll see you Sunday.<br>​-e</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg" width="330" height="230.50137362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1017,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:85828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2zLG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a920ffd-7217-423a-be33-974450287bae_1500x1048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erichaupt.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sunday Musings!
