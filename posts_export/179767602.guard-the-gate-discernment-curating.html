<p><strong>Happy Sunday Friends!</strong><br><br>Here’s one quote I’m musing on this week, two ideas, three favorites, and one question to take with you into the week ahead.</p><div><hr></div><p>One Quote I’m Musing</p><p><em>“The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts”</em><br>    <em>| Marcus Aurelius</em></p><div><hr></div><p>This week I kept coming back to a simpler version of that:</p><p><strong>You become whatever you repeatedly let into your head.</strong></p><p>Lately, the feed has been trying very hard to decide that for you.<br>If you are not choosing the dye, someone else is.</p><div><hr></div><h3>📝 Drowning in “Important” Information</h3><p>Every day this past week, my screen lit up with some fresh “AI is changing everything” headline.</p><p>Anthropic’s latest write-up on AI-driven espionage.<br>New draft language on AI and privacy coming out of Europe.<br>Endless “LLM rankings” and “Top 10 you need to know” lists.</p><p>All of it matters if you care about AI, cyber, or the future of work.</p><p>But letting reality rule:</p><p>I would sit down “just to check one thing,” and 25 minutes later I had 14 tabs open, three half-read articles, a vague sense of dread, and zero decisions made.</p><p>No clarity. No action. Just a nervous system running hot.</p><div><hr></div><h3>🔍 The Feed vs. My Brain</h3><p>Midweek, I caught myself doing the exact thing I warn others about.</p><p>I had a quiet hour blocked to think about strategy.</p><p>Instead, I:</p><ul><li><p>Opened my browser to grab one link I needed for some notes on U.S. financial technologies and FS-ISAC</p></li><li><p>Saw a related EU piece on digital regulation and opened it “for context”</p></li><li><p>Let the recommendation engine hand me a “Top 10 LLMs in 2025” article, which I skimmed because “I probably should know this”</p></li></ul><p>By the end, my mind felt like the browser.  Too many tabs open. Warm, noisy, and useless.</p><p>No decisions. No analysis. No real thinking.</p><p>Just the illusion of productivity because I had seen a lot of “important” things.</p><p>That is the trap: <strong>consumption feels like progress</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h3>🪞The Mirror: It Is Not Just You, It Is All of Us</h3><p>I hear the same thing from:</p><ul><li><p>Senior leaders: “I feel like I’m always behind on AI and cyber. I read all this stuff and still don’t know what to do.”</p></li><li><p>Cyber professionals: “I live in feeds and threat reports, but the signal-to-noise ratio is brutal.”</p></li><li><p>Friends outside tech: “Everything is on fire, apparently. All the time. I’m just tired.”</p></li></ul><p>What they are really saying is this:</p><blockquote><p>“I don’t have an information problem. I have a discernment problem.”</p></blockquote><p>The firehose is not going away.<br>The question is whether you become intentional about how you stand in front of it.</p><div><hr></div><h2>🏛 What Would the Ancient Philosophers Tell Us</h2><p>We like to think our age is uniquely chaotic.</p><p>Endless notifications. Infinite feeds. A new “unprecedented” crisis every week.</p><p>If you dropped Marcus Aurelius into our world, he would probably just look around and say, “Same problem. Different costumes.”</p><p>The Stoics were not dealing with TikTok, but they were dealing with:</p><ul><li><p>Competing schools of philosophy</p></li><li><p>Constant political intrigue and war</p></li><li><p>A stream of letters, speeches, rumors, and public drama</p></li></ul><p>Their answer to overload was not “read everything.”<br>It was <strong>learn to judge what deserves entry into the mind.</strong></p><p>A few of them would have blunt words for our discernment problem.</p><h3>1. Epictetus: Guard the gate</h3><p>Epictetus trained his students to pause before accepting any impression.</p><p>Modern version:</p><blockquote><p>Not every notification is news. Not every headline is reality.</p></blockquote><p>He would tell us to:</p><ul><li><p>Notice the emotional spike without immediately obeying it</p></li><li><p>Ask, “Is this as serious as it feels”</p></li><li><p>Treat the mind like a guarded city, not an open marketplace</p></li></ul><p>Our discernment problem often starts right there.<br>We treat every alert like it is urgent and true.</p><h3>2. Seneca: Depth over volume</h3><p>Seneca complained about people who jumped from book to book, never lingering long enough to digest anything.</p><p>His advice was simple:</p><blockquote><p>“You must linger with a limited number of good authors.”</p></blockquote><p>If Seneca saw our feeds, he would not be impressed by how much we consume. He would ask:</p><ul><li><p>Which ideas have you actually made part of your life</p></li><li><p>Where can I see this in your actions</p></li></ul><p>Information that never shapes your character or your choices is still noise, no matter how smart it sounds.</p><h3>3. Marcus Aurelius: The inner citadel</h3><p>Marcus wrote to himself about building an “inner citadel,” a stronghold of the mind that stays steady while the world thrashes around it.</p><p>He wrote those lines:</p><ul><li><p>In the middle of wars</p></li><li><p>With political enemies</p></li><li><p>During real plagues, not theoretical ones</p></li></ul><p>His move was not to shut the world out, but to remember:</p><ul><li><p>What is within my control right now</p></li><li><p>Which virtues I can practice in this moment</p></li><li><p>Which thoughts make me weaker, and which make me stronger</p></li></ul><p>Applied to us:</p><blockquote><p>We cannot control the firehose.<br>We can control what we give authority to in our own minds.</p></blockquote><h3>4. Premeditation and pruning</h3><p>The Stoics practiced <em>premeditatio malorum</em>: deliberately rehearsing future difficulties so they would not be surprised when they arrived.</p><p>If they lived today, they might say:</p><ul><li><p>Assume your feeds will be noisy and manipulative</p></li><li><p>Expect distraction, outrage, and fear as the default</p></li><li><p>Decide your response before the wave hits</p></li></ul><p>That is the spirit behind high-signal inboxes, input fences, and what I am calling Curated Intelligence.</p><p>You are not trying to escape the time you live in.<br>You are building a filter that lets you live well inside it.</p><div><hr></div><h3>🔑 The Insight: Information Is Not the Advantage. Discernment Is.</h3><p>We talk about AI like it is some alien force that showed up yesterday.</p><p>But the playbook is not new.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and others built entire businesses on three ideas:</p><ol><li><p>Segment people into ever smaller groups</p></li><li><p>Figure out what emotionally moves each segment</p></li><li><p>Feed them exactly that until their view of reality shifts</p></li></ol><p>That is not a conspiracy. That is applied behavioral design.</p><p>Someone always benefits from your overwhelm.<br>If you are not deciding how your attention is spent, that someone is not you.</p><p>BJ Fogg’s behavior model is simple:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt</strong></p></blockquote><p>Right now, the internet has:</p><ul><li><p>Motivation: keep you scrolling, clicking, outraged, or entertained</p></li><li><p>Ability: frictionless apps, infinite feeds, autoplay everything</p></li><li><p>Prompt: notifications, badges, headlines crafted to spike emotion</p></li></ul><p>If you are not designing your own prompts, someone else already is.<br>And their goal is not your clarity. Their goal is your compliance and your time on page.</p><p>To push back on that in my own life, I have started building something I call <strong>Curated Intelligence</strong>.</p><p>For years, I have collected feeds: YouTube channels, podcasts, blogs, newsletters, obscure policy sites, threat intel, research hubs. Great sources. Terrible sprawl. So I am pulling all of it into a single platform I am building for myself:</p><ul><li><p>One place where every input I care about lives</p></li><li><p>Categorized into my core domains</p></li><li><p>Scored for signal versus noise</p></li><li><p>With a “noise dial” I can adjust</p></li></ul><p>On days when I want depth, I crank the filter up and only see high-signal items I know I’ll value. When I want to skim and explore, I loosen the filter and let more variety in.</p><p>It is my way of taking back editorial control over what my brain sees first.</p><p><strong>Curated Intelligence is my personal intel layer, not another feed.</strong></p><p>If you are curious and want to follow along or help me tune it while I build, reply with ”Curated” and tell me you are interested.</p><p><strong>The new power skill is not staying “up to date.” It is choosing what you let update you.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h3>✨ Reframe</h3><p>You do not need more information. You need a stricter border at the edge of your mind.</p><p><strong>Guard the gate.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h3>💡 Two Ideas From Me</h3><ol><li><p><strong>If you cannot remember what you read yesterday, it was entertainment, not strategy.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Your information diet is training your future judgment. Treat it like a workout plan, not a buffet.</strong></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3>🧩 Secret Insight: Start Your Own Curated Intelligence (10 Minutes)</h3><p>You don’t have to build your own platform to start. You just need a tighter gate.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Pick your lanes (2 minutes)</strong><br>Write down the three to five domains that actually matter for the next 12 months.<br>Example: “AI, cyber, leadership, national security, personal finance.”</p><p>Everything else is optional.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Create one High-Signal Inbox (3 minutes)</strong><br>Choose a single place for the good stuff to land:</p><ul><li><p>A “High Signal” folder in your email</p></li><li><p>A “Read This” notebook in your notes app</p></li><li><p>A tag in your read-later app</p></li></ul><p>Commit to one rule: only save items that match your lanes.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Run the 7-Day Input Audit (5 minutes)</strong></p><p>For the next week:</p><ul><li><p>When you see something in your lane, save it to the High-Signal Inbox</p></li><li><p>When you sit down to read, <strong>first open your High-Signal Inbox and pick one item</strong>. Only then are you allowed to touch any feed.</p></li></ul><p>Before you add or click anything, give it a 10-second triage:</p><ol><li><p>Is this in my lane</p></li><li><p>Will this matter in 30 days</p></li><li><p>Do I know what I will do with this information</p></li></ol><p>If the answer is “no” twice, close it and move on.</p><p>When you do read something substantial, turn it into a decision, not just a feeling:</p><ul><li><p>Write one line: “For my team, this means…”</p></li><li><p>Decide one action: brief, policy note, question to ask, or risk to reassess</p></li></ul><p>If there is no action, file it under “interesting, not important,” and let it go.</p><p>When you catch yourself closing a low-value link after the triage, take half a second and tell yourself, “Good call.” It feels small. That little win is what teaches your brain, <em>this is who we are now</em>.</p><p>At the end of the week, ask:</p><blockquote><p>“Which sources actually moved my thinking or my decisions”</p></blockquote><p>Those are the seeds of your own Curated Intelligence. Keep them. Cut the rest.<br>You should feel it by then: fewer tabs, less vague dread, more actual decisions.</p><div><hr></div><h3>🔥 Top 3 AI Stories This Week</h3><p><strong>1. Gartner: By 2028 AI Agents Outnumber Sellers 10× (But Still Don’t Help Much)</strong><br>Gartner’s new sales forecast: by <strong>2028, AI agents will outnumber human sellers by 10×</strong>, but <strong>fewer than 40%</strong> of sellers will report that agents actually improved their productivity.</p><p>Their diagnosis:</p><ul><li><p>Most companies are <strong>bolting agents onto messy workflows</strong>, not redesigning the system.</p></li><li><p>Sales orgs are piling on tools, prompts, and dashboards and then wondering why everyone feels <strong>more overwhelmed, not less</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: <strong>More agents != more clarity.</strong></p><ul><li><p>“If we do not fix how we filter and frame information, adding AI agents will simply automate our confusion.  | <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-18-gartner-predicts-by-2028-ai-agents-will-outnumber-sellers-by-10x-yet-fewer-than-40-percent-of-sellers-will-report-ai-agents-improved-productivity">Read More Gartner</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Europe’s “Digital Simplification” and the AI Act wobble</strong></p><p>The European Commission has rolled out a <strong>Digital Simplification / Digital Omnibus</strong> package that explicitly touches the <strong>AI Act, GDPR, ePrivacy, and related digital rules</strong>, with an eye toward easing compliance burdens and, in practice, <strong>slowing or softening high-risk AI obligations</strong>.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: If your strategy assumes <strong>European AI rules are fixed and “tough forever,”</strong> this is your reminder that <strong>regulation is an evolving input</strong>, not a constant. Great brief topic for boards and leadership: <em>What assumptions in our roadmap break if the AI Act gets delayed or softened? </em> | <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15708-2025-INIT/en/">Read More European Union</a></p><p><strong>3. Deepfake fraud as a quantified, not hypothetical, threat</strong></p><p>Deepfake-enabled fraud is no longer a “future concern.” Multiple 2024–2025 reports are now putting hard numbers behind it.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: You can stop treating deepfakes as “edge cases.” They’re now:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>line item in fraud loss statistics</strong>, not just conference slides</p></li><li><p>A <strong>board-level risk</strong>, particularly for high-net-worth families and executives <a href="https://newomnibank.com/protecting-wealth-ai-fraud/">New Omni Bank</a></p></li></ul><p>Trust is the new attack surface: update verification procedures, challenge-response protocols, and family/exec security practices with actual numbers behind them.                    | <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/fraud/fraud-protection/ai-scams-deep-fakes-impersonations-oh-my">Read More JP Morgan</a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>✍️ One Question to Take Into Your Week</strong></h3><p><strong>If my future judgment was shaped only by what I consumed this week, would I be proud of it?</strong></p><p>Journal prompt:</p><ul><li><p>“The inputs I need to protect my mind from are…”</p></li><li><p>“The inputs I want to double down on are…”</p></li></ul><p>Name specific accounts, sites, newsletters, and people.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>PS: I really am building Curated Intelligence into a real product.
