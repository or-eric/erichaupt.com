<p>Happy Sunday Friends! As the calendar flips to 2025, we find ourselves standing on the threshold of new opportunities, challenges, and growth. Reflecting on the past year and setting clear intentions for the future are powerful ways to transform aspirations into achievements.</p><p>Here is 1 quote I’m musing, 2 Ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please feel free to forward this along to some friends or others!</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing: </strong>The Power Within</h2><p><em>“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”</em></p><p>— Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><div><hr></div><p>I like using the <strong>Wheel of Life</strong> for self-assessment and the <strong>12-Month Celebration</strong> model for goal-setting. It helps me design a year that aligns with my values, vision, and potential. Let’s dive into crafting a fulfilling and productive 2025.</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Reflect with the Wheel of Life</strong></h3><p>The <strong>Wheel of Life</strong> is a great tool for self-assessment, letting us create visual insight into our current satisfaction with our alignment across various life domains. Think of it as your personal life-balance scorecard. Here’s how to use it:</p><p>1. <strong>Identify Key Areas</strong>:</p><p>Break your life into six to eight dimensions. A simple starting point is to group them into <strong>Career</strong>, <strong>Relationships</strong>, and <strong>Health</strong>, with subcategories like:</p><blockquote><p>• <em>Career</em>: Growth, Income, Mission</p><p>• <em>Relationships</em>: Romance, Family, Friends</p><p>• <em>Health</em>: Physical, Mental, Spiritual</p></blockquote><p>2. <strong>Assess Your Satisfaction Levels</strong>:</p><p>Rate each area on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being “I’m struggling” and 10 being “I couldn’t be happier.” For example:</p><blockquote><p>• Growth: 6</p><p>• Family: 8</p><p>• Physical Health: 5</p></blockquote><p>This might feel uncomfortable—it’s a raw, honest look in the mirror. But it’s also the starting point for growth.</p><p>3. <strong>Visualize Your Wheel</strong>:</p><p>Plot your scores on a circular diagram in each area. Connect the points to see your Wheel of Life. An uneven wheel highlights areas of imbalance, which can feel like friction in your day-to-day life. Keep in mind, I’ve never encountered someone with a symmetrical wheel. So if that’s you, I want to chat about techniques!</p><p>4. <strong>Reflect on the Outcome</strong>:</p><p>Ask yourself:</p><blockquote><p>• Which areas scored the lowest?</p><p>• Were any scores surprising?</p><p>• How might these imbalances be affecting your overall happiness?</p><p>5. <strong>Identify Priorities</strong>:</p></blockquote><p>Choose one or two areas to focus on. For example, if your wheel shows a low score in Physical Health, you might decide to prioritize consistent exercise or better sleep.</p><p><em>Take 5 minutes now to jot down your six to eight life dimensions and rate them. Don’t overthink it—this exercise is for you.</em></p><p><em><strong>Quick Hack</strong>: Mind Tools has a fantastic Wheel of Life template if you’d like a ready-made guide.</em></p><h3><strong>Step 2: Envision Success with the 12-Month Celebration</strong></h3><p>Now that we’ve reflected on our current state, let’s look forward. Imagine it’s December 2025, and you’re celebrating the year’s successes. What would make you proud?</p><p>This is the essence of the <strong>12-Month Celebration Model</strong>, many versions have been created, but I love the way Ali Abdaal implements it. Here’s how to use it:</p><p>1. <strong>Project Yourself into the Future</strong>:</p><p>Picture yourself at the end of 2025. You’re surrounded by friends and loved ones, reflecting on the year’s highlights. What achievements are you celebrating?</p><p>2. <strong>Define Your Wins</strong>:</p><p>In each area of your Wheel, what accomplishments would make you proud?</p><blockquote><p>• <em>Health</em>: Ran your first 5k, achieved a personal record in deadlift, or maintained consistent meditation.</p><p>• <em>Relationships</em>: Reconnected with three old friends or deepened your bond with your partner.</p><p>• <em>Career</em>: Landed a promotion, started a side hustle, or found greater purpose in your work.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Write Your Vision</strong>:</p><p>Write these goals as if they’ve already happened. For example:</p><blockquote><p>• “I ran a half marathon and felt stronger than ever.”</p><p>• “I reconnected with my best friend from college, we share a passion for Warhammer and meet up every week now!”</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Break It Down into Nudges</strong>:</p><p>What small, actionable steps can you take each week or month to make these visions a reality?</p><p>5. <strong>Review and Adjust</strong>:</p><p>Life isn’t linear. Set a monthly or quarterly check-in to celebrate progress, recalibrate goals, and adapt to life’s twists and turns.</p><p><em>Grab a notebook or open a document. Write down three things you’d love to celebrate in December 2025.</em></p><h3><strong>Step 3: Combine the Models for Optimal Results</strong></h3><p>Using the <strong>Wheel of Life</strong> and the <strong>12-Month Celebration</strong> together creates a comprehensive framework:</p><blockquote><p>• <strong>Self-Awareness</strong>: The Wheel of Life shows us our current state and highlights areas for realignment.</p><p>• <strong>Goal Setting</strong>: The 12-Month Celebration helps us define clear, motivating goals.</p><p>• <strong>Action Planning</strong>: Together, these tools bridge the gap between where we are and where we want to be.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Practical Steps to Begin The Journey</strong></h2><p>1. <strong>Schedule Reflection Time</strong>:</p><p>Dedicate one hour this week to complete your Wheel of Life assessment and envision your 12-Month Celebration.</p><p>2. <strong>Create a Vision Board</strong>:</p><p>Combine your Wheel of Life and 12-Month Celebration goals into a visual format to keep you focused and inspired.</p><p>3. <strong>Set SMART Goals</strong>:</p><p>Make your goals <strong>Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound</strong>. For example, instead of “get fit,” set a goal to “exercise three times per week for 30 minutes.” Or “decrease my BMI by X”. As long as it is measurable, you’re on the right track.</p><p>4. <strong>Share Your Goals</strong>:</p><p>Creating an accountability lever is a great way to assist your achievement. Share your top goals with a trusted friend, mentor, in the comments section, or send me a message, I can create a Discord or something for the group to chat and support.</p><p>5. <strong>Review Regularly</strong>:</p><p>Set quarterly check-ins to evaluate progress. Life isn’t static—it’s okay to adjust your course as you go.</p><h2><strong>Own It</strong></h2><p>One of my points for improvement this year is physical fitness. During winter break I realized that nearly every time I went to go lift in my garage, there were boxes and junk piled up around it. Creating a literal barrier to my fitness. Now, was this my wife’s fault? Was it my kids? <strong>Absolutely not</strong>, <strong>I own this</strong>. The way I want to work out, the way I have worked out in the past doesn’t align with my family dynamic anymore. I have to come up with something different. I have to change, not them. I have to own it.</p><h2><strong>Embrace the Journey</strong></h2><p>The pursuit of balance and fulfillment is a lifelong endeavor. You can start now by dedicating just 20 minutes to reflect, plan, and visualize. Sketch your Wheel of Life, imagine your 12-Month Celebration, and take that first small step toward a transformative year.</p><p>Remember, progress is built one nudge at a time.

Dissatisfaction isn’t failure; it’s a conversation with your potential.</p><p>2. The most important relationship you’ll ever have is the one with yourself. Invest in it intentionally.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><p>1. “Until we make the unconscious conscious, it will direct our lives, and we will call it fate | Carl Jung</p><p>2. James Clear’s advice on habit-building in <em>Atomic Habits</em> provides powerful tools for staying consistent.</p><p>3. Speediance’s Gym Monster 2. It’s got a small footprint but a “smart” system using magnetic resistance up to 220lbs instead of plates. It’s a way I’m trying to balance out by nudging myself to use something I love (tech and AI) to address an issue!</p><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p><em>If you were to fast-forward to December 2025, celebrating your best year yet, what is one habit, relationship, or decision you would thank yourself for starting today?</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Your next step starts now—what’s one area of your life you’re ready to transform in 2025?
