<p>Happy Sunday Friends! </p><p>Hello Friends! Here is 1 quote I’m musing on this week, 2 ideas, 3 of my favorite things from the week, and 1 question. If you find it useful or interesting, please start a dialogue with some friends or others! I’d love to hear about it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>One Quote I’m Musing</strong></h2><p>“A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.”</p><p> | Greek Proverb</p><div><hr></div><p>This past weekend, I had the privilege of sitting down with cadets and midshipmen from more than two dozen universities at the University of South Carolina. I don’t know what happened between when I was in college and now, but I think I learned more from them than they did from me. These young professionals were incredibly sharp, far more attuned to the world than I remember being at their age. </p><p>Our conversations ranged widely, but one recurring theme emerged: understanding the world and navigating it wisely. I found myself reflecting on their questions long after our discussions ended—what I answered well, what I wish I could say again with more clarity. So, here’s my attempt at that second chance—14 lessons I wish I had known when I was in college, at 20, and even at 30.</p><h3>1. Live an Interesting Life</h3><p>Go live an interesting life. Go out. Take advantage of your youth and the fact that you have time to absorb mistakes and make it up. Go abroad. My life literally changed when I began leaving the confines of my country’s borders. You will make friends despite not speaking the same language, you will experience cultures far older than yours. You will learn that people are people, regardless of race, religion, sex, or creed. Just as you can never step in the same river twice, you will never be the same person you were yesterday. In fact, your experiences in the world will be what make you a better leader, mentor, student, and friend. If you want to be anything, lead an interesting life that will inform and expand the person you are, and who you will become. That person is the person who will inspire those they speak to.</p><p>I spent six months in Iraq with just me, my interpreter, and a team of Iraqi Rangers. We learned a lot in that short time—not just about our jobs, but about each other. Families, dreams, workout regimens, favorite and most hated foods, even the classic iPhone vs. Android debate. It's also where I discovered a love for falafel because I picked it up at a kebab stand one day with my team. That single experience—sharing meals, trading stories, and understanding different perspectives—taught me more about leadership and connection than any classroom ever could.</p><h3>2. Nobody Knows Anything</h3><p>When I took on the role of Chief for the DoD’s Persistent Cyber Training Environment, I had no idea what to expect. On my first day, I was told it was a "dumpster fire" that wouldn’t last. A senior leader even suggested I take the job just to position myself for something better. Yet, it became the sole platform for cyber training across the Department of Defense.</p><p>Nobody knew it would turn out that way. Success isn’t predictable at the outset. As Steve Jobs once said, 'All the rules, all the recipes for success, everything around you was made up by people no smarter than you.' There is always a first time for everything, so never be dissuaded by those who pretend to know the outcome. Take advice, seek wisdom, but don’t let uncertainty stop you from diving in.</p><h3>3. Turn Down the Intensity</h3><p>One of the natural states of youth is a lack of perspective due to a lack of experience. That’s not a bad thing—it makes you creative, optimistic, and able to take risks. But looking back, I see how high the intensity of everything felt. Every decision seemed high stakes. Every task had to be done yesterday, and it had to be perfect. If it wasn’t, I thought I would lose every future opportunity in life.</p><p>But that’s not true.</p><p>Calm down. Change your perspective. Zoom out, zoom in—whatever helps you reset your mental space. Get physically in a different environment if needed. Take a breath.</p><p>Yes, the breakup, the missed opportunity, the criticism, or getting fired feels crushing in the moment. But in the grand scheme of life, you’re going to experience all of these again, many times. And you’re going to be okay. This moment isn’t your life; it’s simply a moment in your life. Ask yourself—how much will this matter next year? In five years? In ten? I guarantee it won’t matter nearly as much as it feels like it does right now.</p><h3>4. Everything Starts with Nothing</h3><p>Nothing remarkable starts fully formed. Every billion-dollar company began as an idea. Every major initiative started with uncertainty. The idea that everything starts at nothing means that great things start from very small things. Zeno would remind us that well-being is realized by small steps, but that is truly no small thing. Trust the process. When I first took on a role that seemed like a dead-end project, I struggled to see the long game. But experienced leaders around me reminded me: great things start from small, unseen steps. Progress is often invisible—until one day, everything clicks into place. They reminded me to trust the process, it had been proven, it would succeed eventually if we just stayed the course. It was much easier for them to trust a process they had seen work over and over, whereas it was all very new for me. It was much harder to trust the process I hadn’t seen work myself.</p><p>Trusting the process is one of the hardest things to do when you’re in the middle of uncertainty. It’s easy to doubt, to wonder if you’re wasting time, or if the effort is futile. But success rarely looks like success at the start. Many of the most impactful projects and initiatives begin as chaotic, fragile ideas that need patience and persistence to grow. Learning to trust the process—even when there’s no immediate payoff—is what separates those who succeed from those who quit too soon.</p><h3>5. Speak With the Dead</h3><p>Zeno of Citium was once told he would "become wise when he had conversations with the dead." He later realized this meant reading. Through books, we can sit at the feet of the wisest, smartest, and most accomplished humans who have ever lived. We get to learn from their mistakes, absorb their insights, and apply their lessons to our own lives without having to live through their failures firsthand.</p><p>Jim Mattis once said, <em>"If you haven’t read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate."</em> That might sound harsh, but it’s true. Your personal experiences alone aren’t broad enough to sustain you. Without reading, without learning from those who came before you, you are leaving an immense well of knowledge untapped.</p><p>We gain wisdom through experience, but reading accelerates that process exponentially. The lessons of history, philosophy, leadership, and life are there, waiting for you to discover them. The greatest thinkers of every age have left their minds on paper—take advantage of them.</p><h3>6. Focus on What You Can Control</h3><p>This is hard—really hard. Even generals, heads of state, and Fortune 500 CEOs struggle with it. Epictetus famously said that our primary task in life is to separate what is in our control from what is not.</p><p>We don’t control what happens; we control how we respond. You don’t control when you were born, what someone else thinks of you, or how others behave. But you do control how you react, what you prioritize, and the effort you put in. The sooner you grasp this, the more effective and less stressed you’ll be.</p><p>Too often, people waste time worrying about things outside their control—external opinions, market fluctuations, bureaucracy. That energy is better spent improving yourself, sharpening your skills, and positioning yourself for success regardless of the circumstances.</p><p>There is power in shifting your focus from what you can’t influence to what you can. Learning this early saves years of frustration and wasted energy, allowing you to channel your efforts into meaningful progress. </p><h3>7. Life Isn’t Fair</h3><p>You will face setbacks and injustices. Expect them. Life isn’t fair. But while fairness isn’t guaranteed, your ability to navigate and adapt is within your control. Understanding how the world operates is a superpower—use it to position yourself effectively. But instead of wasting time lamenting unfairness, learn how the world operates and position yourself to change what you can. Don’t bury your head in defensible ignorance and naïveté.</p><h3>8. Choose the Option That Makes You Wiser</h3><p>In life, many decisions will present themselves. Some options will be comfortable, profitable, or prestigious—but the best choice is often the one that makes you wiser.</p><p>I’ve talked about Euthymia before—the idea of knowing your path, your North Star, and following it through life's twists, turns, and backtracks. Some of the best opportunities don’t look glamorous at first. I didn’t fully appreciate this until I took a position I initially didn’t want—being the assistant to an executive-level leader. It was a role that kind of scared me, which meant that it would likely provide the most growth. It gave me direct access to their thoughts, insights to learn from, and access to rooms and conversations I would never have otherwise been part of.</p><p>Opportunities like these—where you get paid to learn rather than paying to learn—are some of the best deals you’ll ever get. When faced with a decision, choose the option that makes you wiser, that expands your understanding, and that puts you in spaces where growth is inevitable. Some of the best decisions I made involved taking roles that seemed less prestigious but provided invaluable learning opportunities. If you have the option to get paid to learn instead of paying to learn, take it.</p><h3>9. There’s So Much Time</h3><p>At 20, you feel like you need to have it all figured out. You don’t. Some of the best careers start with detours, failed projects, and unexpected pivots. Relationships evolve, and personal growth compounds over decades. The things that seem urgent now—titles, salaries, external validation—matter far less in the long run than consistent progress and learning.</p><p>Time feels endless when you're young, but it moves faster than you expect. Looking back, you’ll realize that the things you rushed didn’t need to be rushed, and the things you postponed were often the most important. Jeff Bezos didn’t start Amazon until his 30s. Colonel Sanders didn’t franchise KFC until he was 62. You are never as ‘late’ as you think you are.</p><p>Yes, you have time to explore, to take risks, and to reset. But don’t mistake having time for having unlimited time. If something matters to you, start now.</p><h3>10. You Don’t Have Forever</h3><p>The flip side: Time is finite. You don’t know how much you have. Death isn’t just something that happens in the distant future—it happens now, in every moment that passes, never to be reclaimed. Seneca put it well: 'You’ve already died for 20 years.' If something matters to you, act now. Procrastination is a thief. If something matters to you, act now.</p><h3>11. Handle Your Issues Now</h3><p>Your past doesn’t stay in the past—it follows you into every decision, every relationship, and every opportunity. The sooner you address it, the sooner you free yourself to move forward.</p><p>No one is going to take a talented dumpster fire over a mature and responsible person with their life together. You aren’t going to pull what you need from your trek to Nepal, or your first orbit of the Earth if you’re in your own head, still stewing over something that happened 10-15 years ago. Having your stuff together shows that you are worth investing those non-renewable hours on. It signals that you can be trusted and accountable when things get rough.</p><p>Handling your personal baggage isn’t just about inner peace—it directly affects how others perceive and invest in you. Emotional stability and self-awareness make you someone worth trusting, mentoring, and promoting.</p><p>You don’t have to be perfect, but you do have to be accountable. The sooner you confront them, the more freedom you’ll have to focus on what truly matters in your life. Don’t let unresolved issues dictate who you become... Childhood wounds, relationship scars, self-doubt—these things don’t disappear. Face them now, with professional help if necessary. Seeking help isn’t weakness; it’s refusing to give up on yourself.</p><h3>12. It’s Not About Credit</h3><p>Arsenal Captain Tony Adams once said, “Play for the name on the front of the shirt, and they’ll remember the name on the back.” (Yes, I’m a football hooligan.) This is especially true when you’re young. It’s not about personal accolades—it’s about contributing to something greater than yourself.</p><p>Your job, especially early in your career, is to make the team better. Be the person who brings value, who elevates others, who makes the whole stronger than the sum of its parts. Take pride in the work itself, in knowing that you played a role in something successful, even if no one calls out your name specifically.</p><p>We don’t always have the right to recognition, but we do have the responsibility to deliver. If you can’t cultivate that mindset—if you’re more concerned with getting credit than getting results—you won’t last long, and you won’t become the leader I know you can be.</p><h3>13. Don’t Be So Scared</h3><p>Worry is a waste of energy. Fear will rob you of opportunities. Showing up to a meeting 30 minutes early just to pace anxiously won’t change the outcome. If something bad happens, you’ll handle it when it comes. Preparing for risk is wise -obsessing over it is not. Prepare for what could go wrong, but don’t let anxiety paralyze you. If something bad happens, you’ll deal with it then. Worrying beforehand only makes you suffer twice.</p><h3>14. Whose Child Will You Be?</h3><p>None of us got to choose where we came from. We didn’t pick our parents, our upbringing, or the circumstances of our childhood. But what we do get to choose is the legacy we align ourselves with—the thinkers, mentors, and values we carry forward.</p><p>As Seneca said, we get to choose whose children we become. We can default to being shaped only by our immediate surroundings, or we can actively seek out the wisdom of those who came before us. We can be the children of our parents alone, or we can be the intellectual descendants of great minds—philosophers, leaders, and visionaries—who shaped the world.</p><p>The point is, this choice is yours. Read widely. Seek mentors. Decide what lessons to carry forward and, in turn, what wisdom you will pass on to others. Your intellectual lineage is yours to shape—so choose wisely. Learn from the best.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Two Ideas From Me</strong></h2><ol><li><p>The person you will become is shaped by the books you read, the people you surround yourself with, and the habits you cultivate today. Treat your future self as a project—design them with intent.</p></li><li><p>You can gain the wisdom of a lifetime in a few short hours. Through books, you can absorb decades of someone else’s experience in just a few hours. That’s an advantage too few people take seriously.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Three Favorite Things From Others</strong></h2><ol><li><p><em>“Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.”  </em> | Warren Buffett</p></li><li><p><em>“Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”  </em>| Ralph Waldo Emerson</p></li><li><p><strong>Podcast: "The Knowledge Project" by Shane Parrish</strong> – Deep dives into decision-making and critical thinking.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>A Question for the Week Ahead</h2><p>What’s one piece of advice you would give to your younger self?
