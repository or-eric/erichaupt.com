<h1>“Changing Yourself”</h1><p></p><p>Hey friends, I had a chat with a new acquaintance, we’ll call them Dan, a couple weeks ago and they asked me how to change themselves. I was very confused for a bit. The following conversation went like this:</p><blockquote><p>Me: “What do you mean?”<br>Dan: “I want to be a cyber guy, but I’m just not a cyber guy”<br>Me: “What do you mean?”<br>Dan: “I’ve been taking X course, and Y class and I just can’t get it”<br>Me: “What don’t you get?”<br>Dan: “I don’t know, it’s hard, I think I’m just not a cyber guy”</p></blockquote><p>To save time, we then had a lengthy discussion about how “changing yourself” is kind of a terrible construct we put on ourselves by wrapping our sense of identity around the things we do (or want to do). </p><p>And to be blunt. I think it’s crap.</p><p>A year ago, I began the process of building Clipt with two of my best friends. We’re almost complete with the app development and soon we’ll do a launch, bring in clients and contractors. I’ve founded a startup; I own a business. So did my friends. </p><p>I’ve run major programs for the Department of Defense. Am I a different person than the guy who crashed his first car into a parked car because I had my head out the window to “see better” in the fog? </p><p>Probably not, but that memory did make me smile.</p><p>Have we changed because we’ve gone through a process? Some say yes. Ok, so what if tomorrow, I do exactly the opposite of everything I do normally? Have I changed? Or did I try something different?</p><p>Getting back to it, the idea is that I think we become overly attached to the things we do by identifying that as who we are. Failure in an endeavor is failure as a person, causing a crisis. Success causes a dopamine rush, the high wears off and we have to succeed in “changing” again.</p><p>I don’t think there are such things as a “morning person” or a “productive person”. There are people who do productive things regularly and people who get up early regularly. They don’t always do them, sometimes they sleep in, sometimes they procrastinate.</p><p>Despite what all those late-night infomercials say, you can’t change. You’re you. You’ll always be you. Our behaviors don’t define our worth as human beings and our membership in the people club isn’t revoked when we make a suboptimal decision.</p><p>When I started my career off, <a href="https://erichaupt.substack.com/i/113778985/its-not-about-you">I struggled to get over myself</a>. If I wasn’t perfect at everything I tried, I was <em>obviously</em> worthless. I overworked, I over stressed, and I failed oh so many times. </p><p>I did, eventually, figure out that I don’t know what I’m doing or who I am. Here’s a shortcut that took me many years to realize. No one really does. That’s ok, it’s called life and growth. </p><p>So, you failed at something, ONCE. Was the thing a good thing? What did you learn? Go do it again. You’re not a failure because you weren’t a breakout success the first time.</p><p>Michael Jordan played in the NBA for fifteen years. He won six championships. Is he a failure because he didn’t win fifteen? Dan isn’t a failure. By saying he wasn’t a cyber guy, he was just giving up before he actually started.</p><p>Wrapping this one up, there is no “self” in what you do. You can put a lot of energy (emotional, intellectual, or physical) into something, but it doesn’t change who you are. You are a person who chooses to do certain things and not to do others. Take the identity defining construct out and you’ll find that the thing or things you want to start, or stop, are not so daunting.</p><div><hr></div><h1>Interesting Things</h1><h3>My New Book to Read<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Night-Angel-Nemesis-Kylar-Chronicles/dp/0316554901/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1683497730&amp;sr=1-1">Night Angel Nemesis</a> by Brent Weeks</h3><p>I don’t often read fiction as of late.

Is Getting Better at Mind-Reading</a></h3><p>Mind reading robots are pure science fiction. Right? right!? Possibly not for much longer. Researchers at the University of Texas, Austin are working on something amazing. They’ve successfully pulled text from the thoughts of human subjects via fMRI data. Meaning they watched the brain activity of someone consuming media with dialogue and brought those patterns back to recognizable text. It’s not 1:1, and not perfect, but it’s impressive. I imagine part of the issue they’ll find is that reading brain activity likely reads the subjects <em>interpretation</em> of what they processed, rather than the exact reproduction of the media they just consumed. It’s exciting regardless!</p><p>| <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/science/ai-speech-language.html">More</a></p><div><hr></div><h1>Quote I’m Musing</h1><p><strong>“We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us, that they were given to us by chance.
