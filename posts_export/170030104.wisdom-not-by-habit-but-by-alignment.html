<p><strong>Happy Sunday Friends!</strong></p><p>This week I’ve been sitting with a tension that’s easy to overlook when you’re used to moving fast:</p><blockquote><p>What happens when your role changes faster than your identity can catch up?</p></blockquote><p>I thought I just needed rest.<br>Turns out I need <em>realignment</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>One Quote I’m Musing</h2><blockquote><p>“First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.”<br>— <em>Epictetus</em></p></blockquote><p>This one resonated because in moments of transition, it’s easy to keep doing before deciding who you’re becoming.</p><p>But wisdom requires pause. This week I realized I was still moving like the person I had been, not the one I was becoming. And the most valuable thing I did was stop long enough to ask: <em>What version of me does this new role require?</em> And slowly begin to move in that direction. Starting with a break.</p><div><hr></div><h2>📝 The Space Between Roles</h2><p>Last week marked the shift.</p><p>I've wrapped my time as an Aide de Camp, a role that shaped me more than I expected, and stepped into my new environment at the ArCTIC.</p><p>Technically, I’d planned to take leave. I even told myself I would. But I chose to push it back.</p><p>Not because I had to. But because I wanted to show up. To get a feel for the mission, the pace, the people. To move the ball forward early.</p><p>And still; somewhere in the middle of that first week, I felt it:</p><blockquote><p>Not burnout.<br>Not overwhelm.<br>Something else: <strong>disorientation.</strong></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>🔍 Story: Wisdom in the Liminal Space</h2><p>I wasn’t in crisis. I was in-between.</p><p>No longer running at the aide’s tempo, not yet settled into the new rhythm. Caught in a space where the calendar changed, but the internal gear hadn’t quite shifted.</p><p>That’s an uncomfortable moment.</p><p>The habits of the old role persist. The expectations of the new one start to build. And in the middle, you begin to mistake <strong>volume for direction</strong>. You confuse <strong>speed with signal</strong>.</p><p>I caught myself defaulting to old behaviors: chasing inbox zero, hyper-responsiveness, preemptive over-prep. Helpful instincts... but only if they match the mission.</p><p>They didn’t anymore.</p><p>And there was one meeting that brought this home:</p><p>I felt a strong need to speak, to add something to the conversation. I paused to examine the impulse. I realized I wasn’t adding something essential. I wasn’t offering signal. I just wanted to <em>feel</em> like I was contributing.</p><p>But I wasn’t in that room to contribute. I was there to observe. To learn. To watch how this new organization operated. And the wisest move I made all week… was to stay quiet.</p><p>I realized <strong>I wasn’t working inefficiently. I was working misaligned.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>🪞 Mirror Moment</h2><p>I’ve seen this same pattern in team transitions, new roles, even startup pivots:</p><ul><li><p>A high-performer steps into leadership… but still behaves like a contributor.</p></li><li><p>A founder pivots the product… but clings to the old roadmap out of comfort.</p></li><li><p>A strategic thinker gets pulled into daily ops… and forgets they were hired for insight, not reaction.</p></li></ul><p>They’re not lacking skill. They’re lacking <strong>clarity</strong>.</p><p>And clarity is the fruit of wisdom, not just intelligence.</p><div><hr></div><h2>🎭 The Information Paradox</h2><p>We are surrounded by more information than any humans in history.</p><p>AI can summarize a hundred pages in seconds.<br>But it can’t tell you what to <em>value</em>. What to <em>keep</em>. What to <em>ignore</em>.</p><blockquote><p>We are drowning in inputs.<br>We are starving for discernment.</p></blockquote><p>Wisdom isn’t about knowing more. It’s about knowing what <em>matters</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>🧭 The Realization</h2><p>This wasn’t a week of collapse. It was a week of realization.</p><p>Not “I’m tired.” More like: <em>“I can’t keep operating at this volume and expect clarity to emerge.”</em></p><p>Instead of powering through, I started pulling back enough to notice:</p><ul><li><p>Where my energy was being spent out of habit, not intention.</p></li><li><p>Where urgency was being manufactured by environment, not mission.</p></li><li><p>Where I was performing momentum instead of choosing direction.</p></li></ul><p>This season isn’t about doing less. It’s about doing <em>with wisdom.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>🔑 Key Insight</h2><blockquote><p>I didn’t just need rest. I needed realignment.<br>Not to <em>step away from the work</em>, but to step <em>into the next version of myself</em> with clarity.</p></blockquote><p>The hardest part of change isn’t the external shift.</p><p>It’s giving yourself permission to stop being good at something that no longer serves you.</p><p>I was proud of how I operated in my last role. But wisdom meant choosing to pause that identity. To step into the new one <em>fully</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>✨ Final Reframe</h2><p>Wisdom doesn’t shout.<br>It <em>waits</em> until you’re willing to hear it.</p><div><hr></div><h2>💡 Two Ideas From Me</h2><p>Before speaking in a meeting, ask: <em>Is this adding signal or seeking validation?</em></p><p>Not every seat at the table requires your voice. Sometimes, presence is the contribution.</p><div><hr></div><h2>🛠️ The Wisdom Filter Protocol</h2><p><em>A micro-habit system for clarity under noise</em></p><ol><li><p><strong>Morning Prompt</strong><br>Ask: <em>“What actually matters today?”</em> Write down 3 true priorities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mid-Action Filter</strong><br>Pause and ask: <em>“Am I operating from instinct or alignment?”</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Evening Reset</strong><br>Write: <em>“What old behavior did I carry that doesn’t belong here?”</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Weekly Reboot</strong><br>Block 30 minutes. No inputs. No tasks.
